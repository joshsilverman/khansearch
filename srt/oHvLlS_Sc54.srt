1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:05,046
This right here is a picture of Carl Linnaeus, and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing the word.

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:08,028
And he's a Swedish gentleman who lived in the 1700's.

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,060
And he's known as the Father of Modern Taxonomy.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:18,033
And the word taxonomy, if you just split it up into it's original root, it really is the science of really classifying things.

5
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:21,089
But when people talk about taxonomy, in this particular in Carl Linnaeus' case,

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,047
they're talking about the classification of living things.

7
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:29,088
So, classifying... classifying, organisms.

8
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:34,048
And his real innovation, before he came about, people realized that you had species of animals

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:39,066
that lions had certain properties that made them all lions, and they could interbreed and things like that

10
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:43,081
monkey or chimpanzees would all interbreed and that would be a separate species

11
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:47,062
and that polar bears were a separate species, and that humans were a separate species.

12
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:51,089
But what he really brought to the table, is he decided, well "Let me just not just group animals into species,

13
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:58,004
maybe I can group species into, into other categories and that's where we get the genus from...

14
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,067
You group similar species into a genus.

15
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:04,033
And then he went even beyond that, because even the idea of grouping things into a genus

16
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:09,027
dated back to the Ancient Greeks. He said, "Well, why don't I group similar genuses together,

17
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:14,066
into orders, orders together into classes, and then classes together into kingdoms.

18
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:20,054
So, really, what he did is, he said, "Well, maybe I can classify, I can create a tree. I can create a tree of life.

19
00:01:20,054 --> 99:59:59,000
I can create a structure so we can really see how far apart any two organisms are."

20
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that's really why he's the Father of Modern Taxonomy.

21
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And he did not have many tools. All he could do was look at the powers, his powers of observation.

22
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
He said, "OK, those kinds of animals, they have fur, or they reproduce in this way, or

23
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they lay eggs, or they don't lay eggs,

24
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or they have spinal columns, or they don't have spinal columns.

25
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So that's the best that he could do, when he did his taxonomy.

26
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But since then, there's obviously been tons of innovations and how we perceive animals

27
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or the natural world, and our tools for studying them.

28
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So one thing that he did not know about is evolution.

29
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This idea of common ancestry and between our understandings of evolution

30
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and our ability to look back at the fossil record,

31
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that helps us get more precise at figuring out which animals are related to which.

32
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We can see, "Do they have a common ancestor, more recent, or further back?"

33
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And what even Charles Darwin didn't have, which we now use as a tool in taxonomy,

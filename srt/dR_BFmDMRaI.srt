1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,060


2
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,033
In the first video on evolution,
I gave the example

3
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,016
of the peppered moth during the
Industrial Revolution in

4
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:09,063
England and how, before the
Industrial Revolution, there

5
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:11,092
were a bunch of moths: some were
dark, some were light,

6
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:12,091
some were in between.

7
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:16,030
But then once everything became
soot filled, all of a

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,016
sudden, the dark moths were less
likely to be caught by

9
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:23,026
predators and so all of the
white moths were less likely

10
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:26,005
to be able to reproduce
successfully, so the black

11
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,014
moth trait, or that variant,
dominated.

12
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:31,060
And then if you came a little
bit later and you saw all the

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,085
moths had turned black,
you'd say all

14
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,007
these moths are geniuses.

15
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:38,075
They appear to have somehow
engineered their way to stay

16
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,067
camouflaged.

17
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:42,006
And the point I was making
there is that, look, that

18
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:46,006
wasn't engineered or an explicit
move on the part of

19
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:49,009
the moths or the DNA, that was
just a natural byproduct of

20
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,000
them having some variation, and
some of that variation was

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,007
selected for.

22
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,085
So that example, that was pretty
simple: black or white.

23
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:58,020
But what about more complicated
things?

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,060
So, for example, here I've got a
couple of pictures of what's

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,031
commonly called the
owl butterfly.

26
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,079
And what's amazing here, and
it's pretty obvious, as I

27
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,075
probably don't have to point out
to you, is its wing looks

28
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:13,037
like half of an owl's eye.

29
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:17,098
I can almost draw a beak here
and draw another wing there

30
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,040
and you can imagine an owl
staring at us, right?

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,031
And here, too, I could imagine
a beak here and you would

32
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:25,017
think an owl there, too.

33
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:28,087
And so the question is how does
something this good show

34
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,089
up randomly, right?

35
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,084
I mean, you could imagine, OK,
little spots or black and

36
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:36,062
white or grey, but how does
something that looks so much

37
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,035
like an eye generate randomly?

38
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:42,043
Now the answer is-- well,
there's a couple of answers.

39
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:46,081
One is why does this eye
exist, or this eye-like

40
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,095
pattern or this owl-like
eye's pattern?

41
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:52,050
And there, the jury's
still out on that.

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,026
I read a little bit about it on
Wikipedia and all of these

43
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,054
images I got from Wikipedia.

44
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,095
In Wikipedia, they said,
look, there's two

45
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,096
competing theories here.

46
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:05,006
One theory is that this, even
though to us humans, the way

47
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,068
we see things, it looks like
an owl's eye, that this is

48
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,083
actually a decoy.

49
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:16,061
When some predator wants to eat
one of these things, they

50
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,087
go for the thing that looks
most substantive.

51
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:23,000
So instead of going for the
butterfly's body, which

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,034
doesn't look that substantive,
they go for

53
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,025
the big, black thing.

54
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,033
They say, oh, that looks like
it's protein rich and it'll be

55
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,015
a good meal.

56
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,031
So they try to snap and bite at
that, and if they bite at

57
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,043
that, sure, the guy's wing's
going to be clipped a little

58
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:38,084
bit and it's going to suck,
but the animal itself, the

59
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:42,053
actual butterfly, would survive,
and maybe it can

60
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,031
repair its swings.

61
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:46,011
I don't know the actual biology
of the owl butterfly.

62
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:48,071
That's one theory, and then the
argument against it goes,

63
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:51,009
well, no, if that was the case,
then you would want the

64
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,006
black spot even further back
along its-- you'd want the

65
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,097
spot way far away
from the body.

66
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:58,028
You'd want it back here instead
of right here, because

67
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:00,053
there's still a chance, if
something chomps at this

68
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,078
little black spot, that
it'll still get the

69
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,075
abdomen of the butterfly.

70
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:08,015
Now, the other theory as to
why this exists-- and, you

71
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:08,071
know, who knows?

72
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,087
Maybe it's a little
bit of both.

73
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,000
Maybe both of these are true.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,096
Maybe this offers
two advantages.

75
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,050
The other theory, and this is
kind of the one that jumps out

76
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,078
at us when we see this , is,
hey, this looks like an owl.

77
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:21,097
Maybe this is to scare away the
things that are likely to

78
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:24,040
eat this dude.

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,043
And it does turn out in my
reading that there are lizards

80
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:31,012
that like to eat these type of
butterflies, and those lizards

81
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:34,046
probably don't like to be around
birds or owls because

82
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,078
those owls eat them, so that
might be a deterrent.

83
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,036
And then the other example, they
said is, look, they tend

84
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,037
to be eaten by this lizard
right here-- this is what

85
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:43,074
Wikipedia told me-- and that
this lizard tends to be eaten

86
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:47,084
by this frog right there, and
that the eyes of this

87
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:50,065
butterfly are not too
dissimilar to the

88
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,006
eyes of this frog.

89
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,008
And, you know, we can debate
whether or not that's the

90
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:57,005
case, and if this was the
predator we're trying to

91
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:59,034
mimic, you could make an
argument that maybe we would

92
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,062
have had more green on our wing,
but that's not the point

93
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:02,021
of this video.

94
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:05,053
But it's a fun discussion to
have as to what is useful

95
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:06,013
about this eye.

96
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,027
But let's have the question: How
did that eye come about?

97
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:11,034
And when I say that eye, I mean
the pattern on that wing.

98
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,097
What set of events allowed
this to happen?

99
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:16,070
Because when I described
evolution, and we know that

100
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,061
everything in our biological
kingdom is just a set of

101
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,054
proteins and then stuff that
maybe the protein-- but mainly

102
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,092
protein, and that protein's
all coded for by DNA.

103
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:29,031
I'm going to do future videos
on DNA, but DNA is just a

104
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,068
sequence of base pairs.

105
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,042
It's a sequence of
these molecules.

106
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:36,062
And we represent adenine,
and guanine and

107
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,091
cytosine and thymine.

108
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,045
Then maybe you have a couple of
adenines in a row and some

109
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,075
guanine and thymine.

110
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:44,083
I'll do a lot more on this in
the future, but the idea is

111
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,057
it's just coded for by this
sequence of these molecules.

112
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:52,000
How do you go from a butterfly
that has no eye to all of a

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,010
sudden an eye that goes there?

114
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,047
Obviously, just one change
that happens

115
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:56,056
from a random mutation.

116
00:04:56,056 --> 00:05:01,037
Maybe that G turns into an A or
maybe this C and this T get

117
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:04,064
deleted so everything-- that
alone isn't going to develop

118
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:08,057
this beautiful of a pattern or
this useful of a pattern.

119
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,087
So how do the random
changes explain

120
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:13,002
something that's this intricate?

121
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,018
And this is my explanation.

122
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:16,083
And obviously, I wasn't sitting
there watching over

123
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,042
the thousands or millions of
years as these owl butterflies

124
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,051
emerged, so this is just my
theory of how natural

125
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:27,032
selection does explain this
type of phenomenon.

126
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:30,077
You have a world where in some
environment you have

127
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:34,098
butterflies, and their wings
look like-- let's say you have

128
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:38,093
some butterflies that are
generally like this.

129
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:42,000
That's their wing, and it's a
very bad drawing, but I think

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,029
you get the idea, and there's
just some general patterns.

131
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,017
We've seen it before.

132
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:47,007
There's variation.

133
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:50,022
And the variation does show up
from these little random

134
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,038
changes in DNA.

135
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:52,092
I think we can all believe
that, that most of these

136
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:54,018
changes are kind of benign.

137
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:56,014
Maybe they just set up
differently where a little

138
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:59,073
pattern will show up or a little
speck of pigment will

139
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:01,062
show up with a slightly
different color.

140
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,047
And we even see amongst
these owl

141
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,002
butterflies, there is variation.

142
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,067
This dude's wing is different
than that guy's wing with the

143
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,004
commonality that they do have
these eye-looking shapes.

144
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,068
And there's not just one;
there's actually multiple.

145
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:13,061
This guy has this other thing
up here that looks

146
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:16,011
interesting, and they have
multiple things, but the one

147
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:20,082
really noticeable feature is
this eye-looking thing.

148
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:23,039
So how do we go from this
to an eye-looking thing?

149
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,007
So the idea is you have
some variation.

150
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:27,006
One guy might look like that.

151
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:33,062
Another guy, or gal, might--
just randomly, their dot might

152
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,041
be something like that.

153
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:39,051
Another gal or guy-- these wings
are really badly drawn,

154
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,073
but you get the idea.

155
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,044
This is the butterfly.

156
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:43,067
This is its antenna
right there.

157
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,029
That's its body.

158
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:52,085
Another butterfly's patterns
might look like this, right?

159
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:54,063
And so, they're just random.

160
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:56,075
But when they go into a certain
environment for

161
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:59,025
whatever reason, maybe one of
its predators-- maybe that

162
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:02,018
theory that these are supposed
to look like eyes is true.

163
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:04,075
And so, actually, maybe
this guy just has a

164
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:08,012
random pattern here.

165
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,082
And so this guy-- and I'm not
saying that it's like

166
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:11,098
definitely better.

167
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:16,007
They're both going to be found
and killed by predators, but

168
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,037
it's all probablistic, right?

169
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:22,026
Maybe this guy has a 1% less
chance of getting a predator,

170
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,047
because when a predator just
looks at him out of the corner

171
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:28,022
of that eye, that little really
hazy region kind of

172
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,047
looks like an eye and the
predator would be better off

173
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,048
just not messing with it, and
they'd rather go after the

174
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:33,074
dude that looks like this.

175
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:35,067
So it's just a slight
probability.

176
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,051
Now, you might, say, OK,
what's 1% going to do?

177
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:40,099
But when you compound that 1%
over thousands and thousands

178
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,093
of generations, all of a sudden,
this trait might

179
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:48,058
dominate because he's just going
to be killed that less

180
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,068
frequently, 1% less
frequently.

181
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:54,022
Now, maybe this guy has a
similar trait, but his spot is

182
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,043
closer to the abdomen.

183
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:59,000
And here, it's a tradeoff,
because maybe some predators

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,094
get scared away by this
concentration of pigment.

185
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:05,031
And once again, I'm not saying
that we're here yet.

186
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,092
We're not at this very advanced,
sophisticated

187
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:08,045
pattern yet.

188
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:11,006
We're at this random
concentration of pigment that

189
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,000
just shows up.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,056
So we see that people who have
this concentration of pigment

191
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:17,005
further away from their
abdomen, they do well.

192
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,032
But when it's too close, maybe
some predators think that

193
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,029
that's actually an insect and
they want to eat it, so that's

194
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,063
actually a bad trait.

195
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,042
So what happens is this guy
dominates, and so within this

196
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,047
population, you start having a
lot of variation, because he

197
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,062
starts representing--
he's more likely to

198
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:34,078
pass on these traits.

199
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,034
And I want to make that
point very clear.

200
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,004
This isn't what happens
over the course

201
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:40,044
of an animal's lifetime.

202
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:43,010
It's not like if somehow I
experience something, or at

203
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,097
least our current theory if I
experience something, that I

204
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:48,091
could somehow pass on that
knowledge to my child.

205
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:53,057
What it says is if my DNA just
happens to have just some

206
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:57,069
variation that happens to be
more useful or more likely for

207
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,053
me to survive to reproduction
and for my children to

208
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,065
survive, then that will start to
dominate in the population.

209
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:05,049
So then the population, you're
going to have variations

210
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,075
within that.

211
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:09,034
Maybe some guys, you know, it's
going to get a little bit

212
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,051
to look like that.

213
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:14,007
Maybe another one's going to
look a little bit like that.

214
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:15,039
Maybe it has some spots there.

215
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,019
You can kind of view it as the
variation as "exploring." But

216
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,067
I want to be very clear not to
use any active verbs here

217
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:26,062
because this is all being done
really as almost a common

218
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:28,069
sense process, where
everything changes.

219
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,088
The changes that are most suited
are the ones that are

220
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:32,035
going to survive more
frequently.

221
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,036
And then the next generation's
going to have more of that and

222
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,054
then you'll have variation
within that change.

223
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,050
And then this one might
be like that, and

224
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,026
maybe this is the one.

225
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:43,053
These were good compared to
that, but now when you're

226
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:47,065
competing amongst themselves,
this one is able to reproduce

227
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:51,040
1% more than this
guy or this guy.

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,024
And so this guy becomes-- and
maybe it's some combination of

229
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,051
all of the above, and
they mix and match.

230
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,062
It's a hugely complex system.

231
00:09:57,062 --> 00:10:00,036
But then this guy represents
most of the population, when I

232
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:03,078
say this guy, I'm saying this
guy's genetic information, at

233
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,005
least as it pertains
to his wings.

234
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,085
And then you get variation
amongst that.

235
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:10,078
Maybe some of it, they have a
little small dot and there's

236
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,083
some dots around it.

237
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,011
Maybe it's like this.

238
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,062
Maybe one of them digresses and
goes back here, but then

239
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:19,088
he has trouble competing so
he gets knocked out again.

240
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:22,005
And then some other people
have it back here.

241
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:23,065
I think you get the
point that this

242
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,091
isn't happening overnight.

243
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,047


244
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,030
These changes can be fairly
incremental, but we're doing

245
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,033
it over thousands
of generations.

246
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,059
So when you're talking about
thousands of generations, or

247
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,060
even millions of generations,
even a 1% advantage can be

248
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,045
significant, and when you
accumulate those variations

249
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:45,034
over a large period of time,
you can get to fairly

250
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,054
intricate patterns like this.

251
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,096
So I just wanted to explain
that, because this is often

252
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:53,082
used as, sure, I can believe
the butterfly moth or I can

253
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:57,030
even maybe believe the examples
of the antibiotics

254
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,028
and the bacteria or the flu,
because those are kind of

255
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,012
real-time examples.

256
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:02,095
But how does something this
intricate show up?

257
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,027
And I actually want to
make a point here.

258
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,042
We think this is more intricate
because we can

259
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,040
relate to it in our
everyday lives.

260
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,050
But if you actually look at a
structure of a bacteria and

261
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,086
how it operates or what a virus
does to infiltrate an

262
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,083
immune system or a cell, that's
actually on a lot more

263
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,067
levels a lot more intricate
than a design.

264
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,076
In fact, the whole reason why
I'm using this as an example

265
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:28,012
is because this is a fairly
simple example as opposed to

266
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:30,029
kind of explaining the
metabolism of a certain type

267
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,050
of bacteria and how that might
change and how it might become

268
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,050
immune to penicillin
or whatever else.

269
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,084
But I want to make this very
clear that these very

270
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,021
intricate things, they don't
happen overnight.

271
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:45,040
It's not like one butterfly
was completely one uniform

272
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,008
hot-pink color and then all of
a sudden they have a child

273
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,082
whose wings looked
just like this.

274
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:50,012
No!

275
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:52,050
It happens over large periods of
time, although there might

276
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,087
be some little weird hormonal
change that does this, but I'm

277
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:57,074
not going to go there,
but that is possible.

278
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:59,057
But I just wanted to make this
point because I think the more

279
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:02,062
examples we see, the more it'll
kind of hit home that

280
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,089
this is a passive process.

281
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,010
We're not talking about these
things happening overnight.

282
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,007
And it's actually really
interesting to look at our

283
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:15,007
world around us and look at
ecosystems as they are today

284
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:18,003
and try to think really hard
about how something came to

285
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,058
be, what it's useful for,
why it might have

286
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:21,062
been selected for.

287
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:27,042
For example, are traits that
occur after reproduction

288
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,007
selected for?

289
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,086
Well, probably not unless they
affect the reproduction of the

290
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,060
next cycle.

291
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,022
For example, you might say,
oh, well, the trait to be

292
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:37,059
nurturing after your
reproductive years, that's

293
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,062
after reproductive years.

294
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:43,046
No, but it helps your
offspring reproduce.

295
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:47,002
But we already see a lot of
diseases, especially once we

296
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,079
get beyond our reproductive and
our child-rearing years.

297
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,027
So once we get into our fifties
and sixties, the

298
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:57,012
incidences of diseases increases
exponentially from

299
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,094
when we're younger and because
they're no longer being

300
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:03,001
selected for, because it no
longer affects our ability to

301
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,088
reproduce, because we've
already reproduced.

302
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,022
We've already raised
our children so

303
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:07,033
that they could reproduce.

304
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:10,013
So the only thing that happens
at that point is now not being

305
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,000
selected for.

306
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,078
So anyway, hopefully, this video
will give you a little

307
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,015
bit more nuance on evolution,
and I want to do a couple of

308
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:17,066
videos like this, because I
really want to make it clear

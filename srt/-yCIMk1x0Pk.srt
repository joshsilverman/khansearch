1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,041


2
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:03,089
Where we left off after the
meiosis videos is that we had

3
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:04,096
two gametes.

4
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,011
We had a sperm and an egg.

5
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,034
Let me draw the sperm.

6
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,078
So you had the sperm and
then you had an egg.

7
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,081
Maybe I'll do the egg in
a different color.

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:18,069
That's the egg, and we all
know how this story goes.

9
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:20,039
The sperm fertilizes the egg.

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,048
And a whole cascade of events
start occurring.

11
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:27,005
The walls of the egg then become
impervious to other

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,019
sperm so that only one sperm can
get in, but that's not the

13
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:31,012
focus of this video.

14
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:35,029
The focus of this video is how
this fertilized egg develops

15
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:38,084
once it has become a zygote.

16
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:42,092
So after it's fertilized, you
remember from the meiosis

17
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:48,067
videos that each of these were
haploid, or that they had--

18
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:51,057
oh, I added an extra i there--
that they had half the

19
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:56,045
contingency of the DNA.

20
00:00:56,045 --> 00:01:00,068
As soon as the sperm fertilizes
this egg, now, all

21
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:03,025
of a sudden, you have
a diploid zygote.

22
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,009
Let me do that.

23
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,015
So now let me pick
a nice color.

24
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:10,062
So now you're going to have a
diploid zygote that's going to

25
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:16,056
have a 2N complement of the DNA
material or kind of the

26
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:20,031
full complement of what a normal
cell in our human body

27
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:25,031
would have. So this is diploid,
and it's a zygote,

28
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:30,003
which is just a fancy way of
saying the fertilized egg.

29
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,056
And it's now ready
to essentially

30
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,039
turn into an organism.

31
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,056
So immediately after
fertilization, this zygote

32
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:39,046
starts experiencing cleavage.

33
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:42,062
It's experiencing mitosis,
that's the mechanism, but it

34
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:44,017
doesn't increase
a lot in size.

35
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:48,085
So this one right here will then
turn into-- it'll just

36
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:52,003
split up via mitosis
into two like that.

37
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:55,028
And, of course, these are each
2N, and then those are going

38
00:01:55,028 --> 00:02:01,051
to split into four like that.

39
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:05,092
And each of these have the same
exact genetic complement

40
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,075
as that first zygote, and
it keeps splitting.

41
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:14,093
And this mass of cells, we can
start calling it, this right

42
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,045
here, this is referred
to as the morula.

43
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,055


44
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,090
And actually, it comes from the
word for mulberry because

45
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,025
it looks like a mulberry.

46
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,093
So actually, let me just kind
of simplify things a little

47
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:28,044
bit because we don't
have to start here.

48
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:29,069
So we start with a zygote.

49
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,024


50
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,021
This is a fertilized egg.

51
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:38,008
It just starts duplicating via
mitosis, and you end up with a

52
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,086
ball of cells.

53
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,068
It's often going to be a power
of two, because these cells,

54
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:46,088
at least in the initial stages
are all duplicating all at

55
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,022
once, and then you
have this morula.

56
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:51,028


57
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:54,084
Now, once the morula gets to
about 16 cells or so-- and

58
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,055
we're talking about
four or five days.

59
00:02:56,055 --> 00:03:01,071
This isn't an exact process--
they started differentiating a

60
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:04,050
little bit, where the outer
cells-- and this kind of turns

61
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,044
into a sphere.

62
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:08,087
Let me make it a little
bit more sphere like.

63
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:12,065
So it starts differentiating
between-- let me make some

64
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:13,037
outer cells.

65
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:15,019
This would be a cross-section
of it.

66
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,015
It's really going to look
more like a sphere.

67
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:22,094
That's the outer cells and then
you have your inner cells

68
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,097
on the inside.

69
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:32,093
These outer cells are called
the trophoblasts.

70
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:34,056
Let me do it in a
different color.

71
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:40,089


72
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,047
Let me scroll over.

73
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,025
I don't want to go there.

74
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:46,043
And then the inner cells, and
this is kind of the crux of

75
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,055
what this video is all
about-- let me scroll

76
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,044
down a little bit.

77
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:54,053
The inner cells-- pick
a suitable color.

78
00:03:54,053 --> 00:04:01,059
The inner cells right there are
called the embryoblast.

79
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,065
And then what's going to happen
is some fluid's going

80
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:06,012
to start filling in some
of this gap between the

81
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,078
embryoblast and the trophoblast,
so you're going

82
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:14,015
to start having some fluid that
comes in there, and so

83
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:18,002
the morula will eventually
look like this, where the

84
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:21,048
trophoblast, or the outer
membrane, is kind of this huge

85
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,075
sphere of cells.

86
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:25,068
And this is all happening as
they keep replicating.

87
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:29,062
Mitosis is the mechanism, so now
my trophoblast is going to

88
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:34,068
look like that, and then
my embryoblast is going

89
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,062
to look like this.

90
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:46,016
Sometimes the embryoblast-- so
this is the embryoblast.

91
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:51,031
Sometimes it's also called the
inner cell mass, so let me

92
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,056
write that.

93
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:56,044


94
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:58,094
And this is what's going to
turn into the organism.

95
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:01,038
And so, just so you know a
couple of the labels that are

96
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,091
involved here, if we're dealing
with a mammalian

97
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:07,070
organism, and we are mammals,
we call this thing that the

98
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,068
morula turned into is a zygote,
then a morula, then

99
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:13,072
the cells of the morula started
to differentiate into

100
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:16,018
the trophoblast, or kind of the
outside cells, and then

101
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:22,075
the embryoblast. And then you
have this space that forms

102
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:26,095
here, and this is just fluid,
and it's called the

103
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:28,020
blastocoel.

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,050


105
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,088
A very non-intuitive spelling
of the coel part of

106
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:37,043
blastocoel.

107
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:40,027
But once this is formed, this is
called a blastocyst. That's

108
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:41,080
the entire thing right here.

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,045
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

110
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:49,087
This whole thing is called the
blastocyst, and this is the

111
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,012
case in humans.

112
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,006


113
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:57,012
Now, it can be a very confusing
topic, because a lot

114
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:59,093
of times in a lot of books on
biology, you'll say, hey, you

115
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:02,057
go from the morula to
the blastula or the

116
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,027
blastosphere stage.

117
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:06,074
Let me write those words down.

118
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,000
So sometimes you'll say morula,

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,025
and you go to blastula.

120
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:14,039


121
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,075
Sometimes it's called
the blastosphere.

122
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:20,012


123
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,055
And I want to make it very
clear that these are

124
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:25,062
essentially the same stages
in development.

125
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:28,086
These are just for-- you know,
in a lot of books, they'll

126
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:32,010
start talking about frogs or
tadpoles or things like that,

127
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,043
and this applies to them.

128
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,088
While we're talking about
mammals, especially the ones

129
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:38,032
that are closely related
to us, the stage is the

130
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,024
blastocyst stage, and the real
differentiator is when people

131
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,036
talk about just blastula
and blastospheres.

132
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,029
There isn't necessarily this
differentiation between these

133
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,048
outermost cells and these
embryonic, or this

134
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:54,029
embryoblast, or this inner
cell mass here.

135
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,035
But since the focus of this
video is humans, and really

136
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,062
that's where I wanted to start
from, because that's what we

137
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:01,042
are and that's what's
interesting, we're going to

138
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:03,081
focus on the blastocyst.

139
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,031
Now, everything I've talked
about in this video, it was

140
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:10,036
really to get to this point,
because what we have here,

141
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:14,026
these little green cells that
I drew right here in the

142
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:18,020
blastocysts, this inner cell
mass, this is what will turn

143
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,019
into the organism.

144
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,025
And you say, OK, Sal, if that's
the organism, what's

145
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:24,098
all of these purple
cells out here?

146
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:27,020
This trophoblast out there?

147
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,087
That is going to turn into the
placenta, and I'll do a future

148
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:34,059
video where in a human, it'll
turn into a placenta.

149
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,097
So let me write that down.

150
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:38,025
It'll turn into the placenta.

151
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,060
And I'll do a whole future video
about I guess how babies

152
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,031
are born, and I actually learned
a ton about that this

153
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:47,057
past year because a baby
was born in our house.

154
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:51,031
But the placenta is really
kind of what the embryo

155
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:54,087
develops inside of, and it's the
interface, especially in

156
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:59,025
humans and in mammals, between
the developing fetus and its

157
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:02,022
mother, so it kind of is the
exchange mechanism that

158
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:05,019
separates their two systems,
but allows the necessary

159
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,079
functions to go on
between them.

160
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,086
But that's not the focus
of this video.

161
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:12,068
The focus of this video is the
fact that these cells, which

162
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:15,087
at this point are-- they've
differentiated themselves away

163
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:18,056
from the placenta cells, but
they still haven't decided

164
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,054
what they're going to become.

165
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:24,020
Maybe this cell and its
descendants eventually start

166
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,063
becoming part of the nervous
system, while these cells

167
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:31,054
right here might become muscle
tissue, while these cells

168
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:36,075
right here might become
the liver.

169
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:40,074
These cells right here are
called embryonic stem cells,

170
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:43,012
and probably the first time in
this video you're hearing a

171
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:45,044
term that you might recognize.

172
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:48,022
So if I were to just take one of
these cells, and actually,

173
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:52,088
just to introduce you to another
term, you know, we

174
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:54,076
have this zygote.

175
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:59,002
As soon as it starts dividing,
each of these cells are called

176
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,092
a blastomere.

177
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:04,001
And you're probably wondering,
Sal, why does this word blast

178
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:08,021
keep appearing in this kind
of embryology video, these

179
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,012
development videos?

180
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:13,048
And that comes from the Greek
for spore: blastos.

181
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:19,002
So the organism is beginning
to spore out or grow.

182
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:21,061
I won't go into the word origins
of it, but that's

183
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,002
where it comes from and that's
why everything has

184
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:23,086
this blast in it.

185
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,067
So these are blastomeres.

186
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:28,097
So when I talk what embryonic
stem cells, I'm talking about

187
00:09:28,097 --> 00:09:34,033
the individual blastomeres
inside of this embryoblast or

188
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,088
inside of this inner
cell mass.

189
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:39,077
These words are actually
unusually fun to say.

190
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:43,015
So each of these is an
embryonic stem cell.

191
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:47,012
Let me write this down
in a vibrant color.

192
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:52,019
So each of these right here are
embryonic stem cells, and

193
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,044
I wanted to get to this.

194
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:56,044


195
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,052
And the reason why these are
interesting, and I think you

196
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,075
already know, is that there's
a huge debate around these.

197
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:03,083
One, these have the potential
to turn into anything, that

198
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,095
they have this plasticity.

199
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,040
That's another word that
you might hear.

200
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,045
Let me write that down,
too: plasticity.

201
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,004


202
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,091
And the word essentially comes
from, you know, like a plastic

203
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,012
can turn into anything else.

204
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,062
When we say that something has
plasticity, we're talking

205
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:21,077
about its potential
to turn into a lot

206
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,062
of different things.

207
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:26,037
So the theory is, and there's
already some trials that seem

208
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:28,038
to substantiate this, especially
in some lower

209
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:31,007
organisms, that, look, if you
have some damage at some point

210
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:36,046
in your body-- let me
draw a nerve cell.

211
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:40,059
Let me say I have a-- I won't
go into the actual mechanics

212
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:43,078
of a nerve cell, but let's say
that we have some damage at

213
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:46,098
some point on a nerve cell right
there, and because of

214
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:50,045
that, someone is paralyzed
or there's some nerve

215
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,039
dysfunction.

216
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,033
We're dealing with multiple
sclerosis or who knows what.

217
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,027
The idea is, look, we have these
cell here that could

218
00:10:57,027 --> 00:11:02,064
turn into anything, and we're
just really understanding how

219
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,040
it knows what to turn into.

220
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,054
It really has to look at its
environment and say, hey, what

221
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,089
are the guys around me doing,
and maybe that's what helps

222
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:10,014
dictate what it does.

223
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,050
But the idea is you take these
things that could turn to

224
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,074
anything and you put them where
the damage is, you layer

225
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:19,090
them where the damage is, and
then they can turn into the

226
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,050
cell that they need
to turn into.

227
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,099
So in this case, they would
turn into nerve cells.

228
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:29,022
They would turn to nerve cells
and repair the damage and

229
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,048
maybe cure the paralysis
for that individual.

230
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:35,063
So it's a huge, exciting area
of research, and you could

231
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:37,070
even, in theory, grow
new organs.

232
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,079
If someone needs a kidney
transplant or a heart

233
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,069
transplant, maybe in the future,
we could take a colony

234
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,098
of these embryonic stem cells.

235
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:48,050
Maybe we can put them in some
type of other creature, or who

236
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,004
knows what, and we can turn it
into a replacement heart or a

237
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:52,065
replacement kidney.

238
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:56,048
So there's a huge amount
of excitement about

239
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,041
what these can do.

240
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,030
I mean, they could cure a lot of
formerly uncurable diseases

241
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,035
or provide hope for a
lot of patients who

242
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:05,012
might otherwise die.

243
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:07,087
But obviously, there's
a debate here.

244
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:10,095
And the debate all revolves
around the issue of if you

245
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:15,012
were to go in here and try to
extract one of these cells,

246
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:17,055
you're going to kill
this embryo.

247
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:21,015
You're going to kill this
developing embryo, and that

248
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,066
developing embryo had
the potential to

249
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:27,013
become a human being.

250
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,087
It's a potential that obviously
has to be in the

251
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:33,051
right environment, and it has
to have a willing mother and

252
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,082
all of the rest, but it does
have the potential.

253
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:40,037
And so for those, especially, I
think, in the pro-life camp,

254
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:44,027
who say, hey, anything that has
a potential to be a human

255
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:47,030
being, that is life and it
should not be killed.

256
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:52,050
So people on that side of the
camp, they're against the

257
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,050
destroying of this embryo.

258
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,087
I'm not making this video to
take either side to that

259
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:01,074
argument, but it's a potential
to turn to a human being.

260
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a potential, right?

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,073
So obviously, there's a huge
amount of debate, but now, now

262
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:10,030
you know in this video what
people are talking about when

263
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,069
they say embryonic stem cells.

264
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,067
And obviously, the next question
is, hey, well, why

265
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,090
don't they just call them stem
cells as opposed to embryonic

266
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,049
stem cells?

267
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,087
And that's because in all of our
bodies, you do have what

268
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,085
are called somatic stem cells.

269
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,085
Let me write that down.

270
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:29,000
Somatic or adults stem cells.

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,010
And we all have them.

272
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,086
They're in our bone marrow to
help produce red blood cells,

273
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:36,015
other parts of our body, but the
problem with somatic stem

274
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:41,077
cells is they're not as plastic,
which means that they

275
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:44,080
can't form any type of cell
in the human body.

276
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,087
There's an area of research
where people are actually

277
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:50,047
maybe trying to make them more
plastic, and if they are able

278
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,089
to take these somatic stem
cells and make them more

279
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:56,028
plastic, it might maybe kill
the need to have these

280
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,065
embryonic stem cells, although
maybe if they do this too

281
00:13:58,065 --> 00:14:01,069
good, maybe these will have
the potential to turn into

282
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,000
human beings as well,
so that could

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,076
become a debatable issue.

284
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:08,012
But right now, this isn't an
area of debate because, left

285
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:12,050
to their own devices, a somatic
stem cell or an adult

286
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,041
stem cell won't turn into
a human being, while an

287
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:19,075
embryonic one, if it is
implanted in a willing mother,

288
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,097
then, of course, it will turn
into a human being.

289
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:24,021
And I want to make one side
note here, because I don't

290
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:30,040
want to take any sides on the
debate of-- well, I mean,

291
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,025
facts are facts.

292
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,089
This does have the potential
to turn into a human being,

293
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,098
but it also has the potential
to save millions of lives.

294
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:39,074
Both of those statements are
facts, and then you can decide

295
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:42,096
on your own which side of that
argument you'd like to or what

296
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:45,066
side of that balance you
would like to kind of

297
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,021
put your own opinion.

298
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,001
But there's one thing I want
to talk about that in the

299
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,088
public debate is never
brought up.

300
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:55,060
So you have this notion of when
you-- to get an embryonic

301
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,057
stem cell line, and when I say
a stem cell line, I mean you

302
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:00,087
take a couple of stem cells, or
let's say you take one stem

303
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:04,054
cell, and then you put it in a
Petri dish, and then you allow

304
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,064
it to just duplicate.

305
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:09,077
So this one turns into two,
those two turn to four.

306
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:12,037
Then someone could take one of
these and then put it in their

307
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,060
own Petri dish.

308
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,020
These are a stem cell line.

309
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,030
They all came from one unique
embryonic stem cell or what

310
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,095
initially was a blastomere.

311
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:24,050
So that's what they call
a stem cell line.

312
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,013
So the debate obviously is when
you start an embryonic

313
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:31,005
stem cell line, you are
destroying an embryo.

314
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,089
But I want to make the point
here that embryos are being

315
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,013
destroyed in other processes,
and namely, in-vitro

316
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,038
fertilization.

317
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,052


318
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:44,074
And maybe this'll be my next
video: fertilization.

319
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:48,069
And this is just the notion that
they take a set of eggs

320
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:49,051
out of a mother.

321
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:52,042
It's usually a couple that's
having trouble having a child,

322
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,027
and they take a bunch of
eggs out of the mother.

323
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,094
So let's say they take
maybe 10 to 30

324
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:59,000
eggs out of the mother.

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,046
They actually perform a surgery,
take them out of the

326
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:06,075
ovaries of the mother, and then
they fertilize them with

327
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:09,088
semen, either it might come
from the father or a sperm

328
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:13,021
donor, so then all of these
becomes zygotes once they're

329
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,009
fertilized with semen.

330
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,086
So these all become zygotes,
and then they allow them to

331
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:19,087
develop, and they usually allow
them to develop to the

332
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:21,048
blastocyst stage.

333
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:25,060
So eventually all of these
turn into blastocysts.

334
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,004
They have a blastocoel in
the center, which is

335
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:32,051
this area of fluid.

336
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:37,091
They have, of course, the
embryo, the inner cell mass in

337
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:41,030
them, and what they do is they
look at the ones that they

338
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,017
deem are healthier or maybe
the ones that are at least

339
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:47,039
just not unhealthy, and they'll
take a couple of these

340
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,015
and they'll implant these into
the mother, so all of this is

341
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,017
occurring in a Petri dish.

342
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:55,026
So maybe these four look good,
so they're going to take these

343
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,084
four, and they're going to
implant these into a mother,

344
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:01,007
and if all goes well, maybe one
of these will turn into--

345
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,066
will give the couple a child.

346
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:05,018
So this one will develop and
maybe the other ones won't.

347
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:09,051
But if you've seen John & Kate
Plus 8, you know that many

348
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:12,034
times they implant a lot of
them in there, just to

349
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,051
increase the probability that
you get at least one child.

350
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:17,030
But every now and then, they
implant seven or eight, and

351
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,068
then you end up with
eight kids.

352
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:21,015
And that's why in-vitro
fertilization often results in

353
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:25,035
kind of these multiple
births, or reality

354
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,026
television shows on cable.

355
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,032
But what do they do with all
of these other perfectly--

356
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:33,010
well, I won't say perfectly
viable, but these are embryos.

357
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,034
They may or may not be perfectly
viable, but you have

358
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:41,098
these embryos that have the
potential, just like this one

359
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:42,068
right here.

360
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:46,033
These all have the potential
to turn into a human being.

361
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:50,073
But most fertility clinics,
roughly half of them, they

362
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,095
either throw these away,
they destroy them, they

363
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:54,003
allow them to die.

364
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:56,069
A lot of these are frozen, but
just the process of freezing

365
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:59,036
them kills them and then bonding
them kills them again,

366
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:04,028
so most of these, the process of
in-vitro fertilization, for

367
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:08,074
every one child that has the
potential to develop into a

368
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,050
full-fledged human being, you're
actually destroying

369
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,073
tens of very viable embryos.

370
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:18,054
So at least my take on it is
if you're against-- and I

371
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,075
generally don't want to take a
side on this, but if you are

372
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:33,031
against research that involves
embryonic stem cells because

373
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:36,057
of the destruction of embryos,
on that same, I guess,

374
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:40,063
philosophical ground, you
should also be against

375
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:47,035
in-vitro fertilization because
both of these involve the

376
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,053
destruction of zygotes.

377
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:52,051
I think-- well, I won't talk
more about this, because I

378
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,031
really don't want to take sides,
but I want to show that

379
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,084
there is kind of an equivalence
here that's

380
00:18:56,084 --> 00:19:00,075
completely lost in this debate
on whether embryonic stem

381
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,092
cells should be used because
they have a destruction of

382
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,098
embryos, because you're
destroying just as many

383
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:08,000
embryos in this-- well, I won't
say just as many, but

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,057
you are destroying embryos.

385
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:12,072
There's hundreds of thousands of
embryos that get destroyed

386
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:16,021
and get frozen and obviously
destroyed in that process as

387
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,011
well through this in-vitro
fertilization process.

388
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:22,000
So anyway, now hopefully you
have the tools to kind of

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,014
engage in the debate around stem
cells, and you see that

390
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:29,086
it all comes from what we
learned about meiosis.

391
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:33,020
They produce these gametes.

392
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,078
The male gamete fertilizes
a female gamete.

393
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:39,050
The zygote happens or gets
created and starts splitting

394
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,049
up the morula, and then it
keeps splitting and it

395
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,073
differentiates into the
blastocyst, and then this is

396
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,023
where the stem cells are.

397
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:50,031
So you already know enough
science to engage in kind of a

398
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,076
very heated debate.

399
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:53,087

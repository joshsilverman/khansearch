1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,053


2
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:02,098
In the last video we discovered
what seems like a

3
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:04,058
problem with the Calvin Cycle.

4
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:09,034
That you have this big protein
here, enzyme, that facilitates

5
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:10,028
the Calvin Cycle.

6
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:13,078
All of the molecules that are
involved bond to this and then

7
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:16,067
it twists and turns and it jams
things together so that

8
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:17,057
they react properly.

9
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:19,089
And we know what this
is, the RuBisCo.

10
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:24,089
RuBisCo enzyme, or ribulose

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,014
bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase.

12
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,023


13
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:32,077
And we know when the Calvin
Cycle operates properly you'll

14
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:37,088
have some carbon dioxide
attached in one

15
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:39,024
part of this enzyme.

16
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:43,043
And then you'll have some RuBP,
or maybe you could call

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,039
it the proper word, ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,088
And they're going to react.

19
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,064
And then after they react, if
everything with the Calvin

20
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:56,003
Cycle is going properly, they're
going to react and

21
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,082
form-- they're going to be
jammed together and then split

22
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:02,000
into-- for one molecule of that
and one molecule of that,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,054
you're going to have
two molecules of

24
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,079
3-phosphoglycerate.

25
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,076


26
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:13,034
In the last video I started with
three of these and three

27
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,018
of these so I ended up
with six of these.

28
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,018
But for every one of these you
end up with two of these.

29
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:19,004
This is the proper
Calvin Cycle.

30
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:22,073
Then these turn into your
phosphoglyceraldehydes.

31
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,054
These turn into two

32
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:25,059
phosphoglyceraldehydes, or PGALs.

33
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:28,012


34
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,075
And then for every six of these
that are produced-- and

35
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:33,064
maybe I should write a three
here, a three here and then

36
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:38,017
I'll have six of these-- and
for every six of these that

37
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,084
are produced, five go back into
the cycle to produce.

38
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:46,031
So five PGALs, or glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate go

39
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,093
back into the cycle to produce
the ribulose bisphosphate.

40
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:54,037
And one of them is kind of our
end product of photosynthesis

41
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:56,053
that can be used to produce
other carbohydrates.

42
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:58,006
So, one PGAL.

43
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:01,028
And the whole problem, we saw
with the Calvin Cycle, is that

44
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:05,042
RuBisCo does not only
fix carbon dioxide.

45
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,031
That instead of carbon
dioxide we might

46
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:09,050
have an oxygen molecule.

47
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,088
We might have an oxygen molecule
that jumps in here.

48
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:16,011
And it can also attach to
the RuBisCo enzyme.

49
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,009
And in that situation, the
oxygen and the ribulose

50
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:22,005
bisphosphate react.

51
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:25,021
So if we had three ribulose
bisphosphates and three

52
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:28,078
oxygens, instead of producing
six phosphoglycerates we're

53
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:33,071
only going to produce five
phosphoglycerates and we're

54
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,090
going to produce five
phosphoglycolates.

55
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:43,009


56
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,059
Which is that byproduct that
gets processed later on.

57
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,052
And then these five.

58
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,052
You're going to have
five here.

59
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,088
You can't have one left over.

60
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,041
And then you're not going
to produce anything.

61
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,037
In doing this whole cycle
you have to use up a

62
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,096
bunch of ATPs and NADHs.

63
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:56,043
So this is a problem.

64
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,028
If there's a lot of oxygen
present, or even a little bit

65
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,030
of oxygen present, it's
going to make this a

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,091
little bit less efficient.

67
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:06,040
Because every now and then an
oxygen's going to jump in

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,077
where a carbon dioxide is needed
to actually produce an

69
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,065
actual carbohydrate
in the end.

70
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:15,080
So how do plants solve
this problem?

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,013
Well, one solution would be to
operate the Calvin Cycle in an

72
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,050
environment where there is
very, very little oxygen.

73
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,090
Or you can almost
say no oxygen.

74
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,078
And this is exactly what
some plants do.

75
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:29,097
You're like, wait,
how do I do that?

76
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:32,059
Do I have to go to a planet
where there's no oxygen?

77
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:32,084
No!

78
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:35,097
What they do is-- and to
understand this we'll have to

79
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:40,017
understand a little bit of
the actual make-up of

80
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,009
the leaf of a plant.

81
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,099
And that doesn't hurt because
everything we've been doing

82
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,018
now has been biochemistry.

83
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,066
it's nice to see leaves.

84
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:49,075
So if I draw-- let's say
that that is a leaf.

85
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,087
That is a leaf.

86
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,099
I can make it look
nice like a leaf.

87
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,062
That's a nice looking leaf.

88
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:57,031
On your leaf's surface, and
actually on both sides of it,

89
00:03:57,031 --> 00:04:01,036
you have these little pores,
these little holes on the

90
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:01,093
leaf's surface.

91
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,002
They are actually surrounded
by these things

92
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:03,093
called guard cells.

93
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:05,078
But the important thing is that
these little pores-- and

94
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,093
they're actually much smaller
than that; you'd have to get a

95
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:10,084
microscope to actually see
them-- they're called stomata.

96
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,056
Or one individual of
these pores or

97
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:16,057
holes is called a stoma.

98
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:20,093
And this is where the oxygen
and the-- mainly the carbon

99
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,092
dioxide-- but this is where the
air enters the cell and

100
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,087
this is actually where
water vapor is also

101
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,086
released from the cell.

102
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:33,042
If we draw a cross section of
a leaf, so let me do my best

103
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:36,081
to draw a cross section
like this.

104
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,027
Let me draw it like that
and maybe that's the

105
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:41,030
bottom of the leaf.

106
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,081
This would be my stoma.

107
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,063
This is the actual opening.

108
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:48,041
This is the actual opening and
plants can actually open and

109
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,066
close their stomata.

110
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,060


111
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,075
The plural of stoma
is stomata.

112
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,051
They can open and close
their stomata.

113
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,075
But the important thing to
realize is what's going on

114
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:59,038
inside the cell.

115
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,081
So most plants, you have this
whole photosynthetic process,

116
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:07,018
or photosynthesis process,
occurring in these mesophyll

117
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,008
cells, which are really just
these middle layer cells.

118
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,018
And I'll do a detailed video
in the future about the

119
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:13,097
anatomy of a plant.

120
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:17,052
But these are the
mesophyll cells.

121
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:21,087
This is where photosynthesis
normally occurrs.

122
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,088
And because they use carbon
dioxide, or they need air--

123
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:26,011
actually I drew it wrong.

124
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:26,099
Let me draw it a little
bit better.

125
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,005
There's actually space
between them, so that

126
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,051
air can get to them.

127
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:34,070
There's mesophyll, I'm doing
a very rough drawing.

128
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,094
But in this situation air can
enter through a stoma and then

129
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:41,064
it can fill the space between
these mesophyll cells and it

130
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:44,000
can provide air to the
mesophyll cells.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,074
And when I say air, that air is
made up of carbon dioxide

132
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,043
and oxygen and nitrogen
and all the things

133
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,017
that are in our air.

134
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,031
And of course, it needs the
carbon dioxide to actually

135
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,056
perform the Calvin Cycle.

136
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:58,081
Now, we just said that it's
not just getting CO2.

137
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,093
If it was just getting CO2
you wouldn't worry about

138
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,043
photorespiration.

139
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:05,017
It's also getting oxygen.

140
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:07,027
It's also getting molecular
oxygen.

141
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:10,043
So what can the plant to
do to prevent this?

142
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,076
And not all plants-- you know,
most plants just deal with

143
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,056
photorespiration.

144
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:16,054
It's just a little less
efficient than the ideal.

145
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:20,043
But some plants have-- I guess
we could say-- evolved past

146
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:22,012
the photorespiration problem.

147
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:24,049
And these are called
C-4 plants.

148
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:28,029
Or they perform C-4
photosynthesis.

149
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,030


150
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,050
And we'll understand, hopefully
in a few minutes,

151
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,000
why it's called C-4.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,098
Just as a reminder, when we go
up to the mechanism up here.

153
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:42,001
The classic Calvin Cycle, the
first byproduct is this

154
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,085
phosphoglycerate, this
is a 3-carbon chain.

155
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:48,087
So it's saying that the first
time that you fix carbon

156
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:51,023
dioxide, or actually the first
time you fix carbon dioxide or

157
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,022
oxygen, but let's say the first
time you fix carbon

158
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:56,081
dioxide you end up with a
3-carbon chain molecule.

159
00:06:56,081 --> 00:07:02,068
That's why this is called
C-3 photosynthesis.

160
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,031
So, that's a clue.

161
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:08,033
On C-4 plants, the very first
time that they fix carbon

162
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:11,087
dioxide they must end up with
a 4-carbon molecule.

163
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:15,014
And what they do-- and this is
the interesting thing-- is you

164
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:19,035
have all your mesophyll cells
that are out here.

165
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:20,011
They're getting air.

166
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:22,002
They're getting carbon
dioxide.

167
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:24,048
You know, they're getting carbon
dioxide and they're

168
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,058
getting oxygen and
whatever else.

169
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,055
So you have all your mesophyll
cells that are getting air.

170
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:31,055
But you also have cells that
are deeper within, more

171
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:35,014
embedded within the leaf that
aren't being exposed directly

172
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:38,006
to the air coming through
the stomata.

173
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:39,069
So you have these bundle-sheath
cells.

174
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,044
And these are actually the cells
that surround the actual

175
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:46,030
pipes in the plant that
distribute the fluid up and

176
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,075
down the plant.

177
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,087
And we'll do a whole video on
the anatomy of the plant.

178
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:51,056
I really just want you to
understand what's going on in

179
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:53,042
C-4 photosynthesis.

180
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:56,069
So you have these other cells
that are more embedded.

181
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,025
They don't have direct
access to the air.

182
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,093
So these are bundle-sheath
cells.

183
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:05,094


184
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:09,045
And what these plants do is,
the carbon dioxide comes in

185
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:12,002
and-- so in the standard Calvin
Cycle, everything

186
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,004
happens in the mesophyll cells
and you have to deal with

187
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,036
photorespiration.

188
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:20,010
In your C-4 plant, or your
plants performing C-4

189
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,094
photosynthesis, what happens
is the carbon dioxide comes

190
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:26,081
in-- so this is in the
mesophyll cell.

191
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,001
Let me be neat about it.

192
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:37,014
So in our mesophyll cell, that's
that right there, you

193
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:41,035
have CO2 coming in
and it reacts.

194
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:45,092
Instead of reacting with RuBP
or ribulose bisphosphate, it

195
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:50,058
reacts with another very hairy
sounding compound, we'll just

196
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,061
call it PEP.

197
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:57,058
But it's phosphoenolpyruvate
So that's PEP.

198
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:02,087
You just have to remember,
it is a 3-carbon chain.

199
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,013
Now let me write down the word,
because sometimes you

200
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:07,063
might want to know, what
does PEP stand for?

201
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:14,047
It's phosphoenolpyruvate or

202
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:16,090
phosphoenolpyruvic acid Either way.

203
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,044


204
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:22,026
3-carbon molecule, it's got
other stuff hanging off of

205
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,092
this but we just have to
remember the carbons.

206
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:26,062
So when these two react what are
you going to end up with?

207
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,087
Well you could guess.

208
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:29,092
You have one carbon, you
have three carbons.

209
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:32,096
You're going to end up with
a 4-carbon molecule.

210
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:37,075


211
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:42,098
And this reaction right here
is facilitated, not by

212
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:44,046
RuBisCo, ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase.

213
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:47,084


214
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:50,072
It's facilitated by a
different enzyme.

215
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:51,091
And this is the key.

216
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,030
This is the key for C-4.

217
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,097
This is a different enzyme.

218
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:58,036
This is called PEP
carboxylase.

219
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,074
Let me write it down.

220
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:00,099
PEP carboxylase.

221
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,033


222
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,071
And that's a fitting name.

223
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:09,087
Remember, RuBisCo or ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase, it

224
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:15,048
reacted ribulose bisphosphate
with carbon or oxygen.

225
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,057
That's where that oxygenase
comes from.

226
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:20,040
But now we have something
that reacts PEP, our

227
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,058
phosphoenolpyruvate with
carbon dioxide.

228
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:26,077
So it's called PEP
carboxylase.

229
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:28,079
Actually this is carboxylase,
not carboxylate.

230
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,032


231
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:32,033
It's an enzyme.

232
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,089
This is PEP carboxylase.

233
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,037
And what's special about PEP
carboxylase, and why it's

234
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:39,091
useful in preventing
photorespiration, is that it

235
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,040
can only fix carbon.

236
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,082


237
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:49,041
Not oxygen.

238
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,095
So you can imagine, this
is occurring in

239
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:51,083
the mesophyll cell.

240
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,001
You have oxygen and carbon
dioxide running around here.

241
00:10:55,001 --> 00:11:00,030
But only carbon dioxide can
react with the PEP via the PEP

242
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,096
carboxylase.

243
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:04,075
So then they react, they
actually produce oxaloacetic

244
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:15,021
acid or oxaloacetate And you
might remember this from the

245
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:15,096
Kreb Cycle.

246
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:19,050
This was the thing that was the
first reactive species in

247
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,033
our Kreb Cycle.

248
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:24,047
So all of these molecules, they
keep showing up in our

249
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,037
chemical pathways.

250
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:27,098
And that's interesting if you
find that type of thing

251
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:28,067
interesting.

252
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:32,028
But the important thing is,
they form oxaloacetate and

253
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:35,064
then oxaloacetate
gets converted.

254
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:37,097
Let me make it, I made
this not as neatly as

255
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,087
I would like to.

256
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:44,062
But then that gets converted to
either malate or aspartate

257
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:47,009
but these are all 4-carbon
molecules.

258
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,033
They're a little different;
they're going to have

259
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,004
different oxygens and hydrogens
hanging off of them.

260
00:11:51,004 --> 00:12:04,099
But this is either malate
or aspartate

261
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:09,021
Most books will just say, oh it
will eventually just form

262
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,094
into malate only.

263
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:17,074
And then this, this malate, will
then essentially react to

264
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,096
produce carbon dioxide.

265
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,073
And you're like, wait.

266
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,072
That doesn't make sense.

267
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,079
I have carbon dioxide, it gets
fixed on oxaloacetic acid and

268
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,061
then it gets turned into malate
or aspartate And then

269
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,035
later I'm going to turn into
carbon dioxide again.

270
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,061
What's the whole point?

271
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,007
And this is the key.

272
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,044
This is the whole crux
of the issue.

273
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:40,062
So now this malate is going to
be converted back into PEP and

274
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:42,037
carbon dioxide.

275
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,096
You're like, what was
the whole point

276
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,008
of this whole reaction?

277
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,037
I just ended up with carbon
dioxide and PEP again.

278
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:48,069
I'm just going in circles.

279
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,083
But the neat thing about this,
and the reason why this

280
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:55,053
prevents photorespiration is
that this part, this part of

281
00:12:55,053 --> 00:13:01,002
the reaction right here-- maybe
I should do it like

282
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:03,062
this-- this part of the
reaction occurs in the

283
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,000
mesophyll cell.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,098
It occurs up here.

285
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:10,044
It occurs over here in
the mesophyll cell.

286
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:12,025
So you have this malate.

287
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:16,012
And then the malate actually
gets transferred into these

288
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:18,009
bundle-sheath cells.

289
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:23,009
So the malate gets transferred
into the bundle-sheath cells

290
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:28,034
via little tubes that connect
the cells called plasmodesmata

291
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:30,011
Sounds like the name
of a horror movie.

292
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:34,028
So let me draw this a
little bit neater.

293
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:40,008
So over here you have, with
exposure to the air, you have

294
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,090
your mesophyll cell.

295
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,024
Air is coming in, O2, CO2,
everything is coming in.

296
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:50,058
But only CO2 can be
fixed with PEP.

297
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:54,086
So you have the PEP here, the
phosphoenolpyruvate So you

298
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:56,080
have your Pep here.

299
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,087
Only CO2 can be reacted with
PEP because of the PEP

300
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,012
carboxylase.

301
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:05,099


302
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,049
This is the enzyme
that's operating.

303
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,057
So this is much more specific
than the ribulose bisphosphate

304
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,025
carboxylase, or the RuBisCo.

305
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:16,055


306
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,008
So the oxygen just
gets ignored.

307
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:20,080
Even though it's hanging around
these mesophyll cells.

308
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,095
And then these, this
gets converted.

309
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,050
Oxaloacetic acid.

310
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,072
And then to malate.

311
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:32,020
But once it gets converted to
malate, the malate gets

312
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,065
transferred deeper into the
actual cell via these

313
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:43,086
plasmodesmata So this might be
butting right up against

314
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:46,040
bundle-sheath cell, that's
deeper in the cell.

315
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,027
This bundle-sheath cell has
no access to oxygen.

316
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,017
So the malate comes in.

317
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,097
You have these little pipes
that connect the cell.

318
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:57,045
Maybe I'll just draw one pipe.

319
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,034
So let's say there's one pipe.

320
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:01,090
So the malate can come here.

321
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,003
And then, within this deeper
cell, within this

322
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:12,025
bundle-sheath cell, it can
then react to form carbon

323
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:15,060
dioxide and pyruvate.

324
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,014
And then the pyruvate--
so let's just

325
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:19,075
say this is the pyruvate.

326
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:23,003
That pyruvate can then later
go back to actually

327
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:24,016
form the PEP again.

328
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:26,091
So this can go back through
your plasmodesmata

329
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,080
and form the PEP.

330
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,087
So the whole value here is, now
in the bundle-sheath cell,

331
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:34,069
I have an environment that
only has carbon dioxide.

332
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,021
I have no oxygen here.

333
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,014
I was able to essentially
select for the

334
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:40,015
carbon dioxide outside.

335
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:43,009
Or closer to the air in
the mesophyll cell.

336
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,036
And now that I'm deeper within
the plant, I'm in an

337
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:49,051
environment that only has CO2,
because I've already

338
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,024
selected for it.

339
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:53,089
And now I can perform
the Calvin Cycle.

340
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:56,096
So now, inside this deeper
cell, inside this

341
00:15:56,096 --> 00:16:00,094
bundle-sheath cell, I can fix
the carbon dioxide with the

342
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:04,040
ribulose bisphosphate using
RuBisCo, just like we learned

343
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,062
in the original Calvin Cycle.

344
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:09,055
And we have the whole cycle
and we produce our sugars.

345
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:12,066
We produce our
phosphoglyceraldehydees or our

346
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,035
PGALs, whatever you
want to call them.

347
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:17,092
And the whole value this is,
that we were able to avoid the

348
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,021
photorespiration problem.

349
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,075
Because now the Calvin Cycle is
occurring in an environment

350
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,063
that only has carbon dioxide.

351
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,058
And I think I already mentioned
it, but this is

352
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:27,004
called C-4 photosynthesis.

353
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:30,041


354
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,012
And it's an adaption to make
sure that you don't waste

355
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:38,004
cycles of your Calvin Cycle
through photorespiration.

356
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:41,012
And of course it was called C-4,
because the first time

357
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,035
that carbon gets fixed
it doesn't happen

358
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,038
in the Calvin Cycle.

359
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:47,044
It happens up here, with
PEP carboxylase.

360
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:51,005
And it gets fixed with PEP
into a 4-carbon chain.

361
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:55,073
And that's why it's called
C-4 photosynthesis.

362
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:57,021

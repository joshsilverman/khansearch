1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,055


2
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:02,091
I made a slight error
in the electron

3
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:04,015
transport chain video.

4
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:06,004
And I just wanted to correct
it in this one.

5
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,053
And it's also an opportunity for
me to include a little bit

6
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:11,056
of terminology that I forgot
to include in that video.

7
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:14,031
So when I described the electron
transport chain, you

8
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,080
remember, it's just you have
some high-energy electrons in

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,051
NADH and they get transferred
from one molecule to another.

10
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:22,080
And as they get transferred
they go into lower energy

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,087
states and they release
energy.

12
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:28,053
And then the final electron
acceptor was oxygen.

13
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:30,019
Oxygen got reduced right here.

14
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,018
But if you look at both sides of
this equation, the mistake

15
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:34,050
was, I need two hydrogens.

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,039
If I have two hydrogens on the
right-hand side of the water,

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,071
I need two hydrogens on
the left-hand side.

18
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,032
So there should be
a 2 right there.

19
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:46,028
So that was what I would
consider to be a minor mistake

20
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:47,020
in the last video.

21
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,050
But this also gives me a chance
to introduce you to

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,010
some more terminology.

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,085
So this whole process, we know
that this is called oxidation.

24
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,068
When NADH loses a hydrogen.

25
00:00:57,068 --> 00:01:00,082
Remember oxidation is losing,
formally electrons.

26
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:02,077
But when it loses the hydrogen,
it loses the

27
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:05,064
opportunity to hog that
hydrogen's electrons.

28
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,020
So this whole process of the
electron transport chain is

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,045
one molecule after another
getting oxidized until you

30
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:14,040
have a final electron
acceptor in water.

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,028
So this is-- obviously you could
call this oxidation.

32
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:18,095
You know, just very generally.

33
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:22,040
And then the second part of the
electron transport chain--

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,081
or maybe we shouldn't even call
this part of the electron

35
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,071
transport chain-- the
process where the

36
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,062
ATP is actually formed.

37
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:32,036
The adding of a phosphate group
to another molecule is

38
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,061
called phosphorylation.

39
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:40,079


40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,000
So the whole process of creating
ATP through the

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,059
electron transport chain.

42
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:48,039
Remember the electron transport
chain releases

43
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,001
energy that creates this
hydrogen gradient.

44
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,054
It pumps the hydrogens to
the outer compartment.

45
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:58,064
And then that gradient, those
hydrogens that want to get

46
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:02,012
back into the matrix,
essentially going back through

47
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:03,073
this ATP synthase.

48
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:06,087
This process of generating ATP
this way is called oxidative

49
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:08,012
phosphorylation.

50
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:17,024


51
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:18,012
It's a good word to know.

52
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,043
You might see it on some
standardized tests or on your

53
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:23,056
exams. And it's called
this because you have

54
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,077
an oxidative part.

55
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:30,019
Each of these molecules gets
oxidized in the electron

56
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,021
transport chain as they lose
their hydrogens or as they

57
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,050
lose their electrons.

58
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,088
That creates a hydrogen
gradient.

59
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:40,028
And then that, through
chemiosmosis, allows for

60
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,043
phosphorylation.

61
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,066
So that's another good
word to know.

62
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:47,006
The transfer of these hydrogens,
these kind of going

63
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,074
through this membrane
selectively.

64
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:51,090
This membrane, this ATP
synthase, wouldn't allow just

65
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,050
any molecule to go through it.

66
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,036
It's allowing these hydrogen
protons to go through it.

67
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,075
This process right here of this
hydrogen going through is

68
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,000
called chemiosmosis.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,003


70
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:05,090
Another good word to know.

71
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,087
So the entire process
is called oxidative

72
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,006
phosphorylation.

73
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,053
They don't happen at
the same time.

74
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:14,046
Oxidative generates the energy
because the energy to push the

75
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,013
hydrogens out.

76
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:17,043
And then the phosphorylation
happens as the hydrogens

77
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:21,005
experience chemiosmosis and go
back in and turn this little

78
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:27,015
axle and then push the ADP and
the phosphate groups together.

79
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:30,008
And then you can contrast
that with substrate.

80
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:34,000
Substrate phosphorylations.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,059
Since I'm in the mood to
introduce you to terminology.

82
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,094
Substrate phosphorylation.

83
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:41,012
This is actually what happens
when the ATP is produced

84
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,027
directly in glycolysis
in the Krebs cycle.

85
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:49,041


86
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:54,036
And this is where you have an
enzyme directly helping to

87
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,099
peruse the ATP without
any type of

88
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,062
chemiosmosis or proton gradient.

89
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:02,047
So if you imagine an
enzyme, some blurb,

90
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,041
some big protein blurb.

91
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:09,011
And let's say it has the
ADP there with its

92
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,050
two phosphate groups.

93
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,088
And then maybe it has another
phosphate group that attaches

94
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:15,022
at some other part of the
enzyme, this enzyme

95
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:19,018
facilitates without any kind of
chemiosmosis or oxidation.

96
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:23,095
It facilitates, probably in
conjunction with other energy

97
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:27,087
releasing reactions that may be
occurring on other parts of

98
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:28,050
the enzyme.

99
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,082
So maybe you can imagine a
little spark right there and

100
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:34,081
then that twists this
entire enzyme.

101
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,056
This isn't exactly how
it might work,

102
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,063
but it's a good idea.

103
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:40,008
And then these two things maybe
get pushed together.

104
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,077
When it's just an enzyme
without any of this

105
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:44,082
chemiosmosis that's driven by
oxidation, like we learned in

106
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:47,087
the electron transport chain,
we call this substrate

107
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,077
phosphorylation.

108
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:52,035
And the substrates are just the
things that attach to the

109
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,075
enzyme and have something
performed on them.

110
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:56,025
So anyway, hopefully you
found this little

111
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,070
video mildly useful.

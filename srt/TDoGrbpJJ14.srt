2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:08,034


3
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,046
And we normally associate
it with negative things.

4
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:14,064
You say bacteria, those are
germs. So we normally

5
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:18,080
associate those with germs, and
they indeed are germs, and

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,060
they cause a whole set
of negative things.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,053
Or at least from the standard
point of view, people believe

8
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:26,046
that they cause a whole bunch
of negative things.

9
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:30,012
So let's just list them all
just to make sure we know

10
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:31,066
about them, we're all
on the same page.

11
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:35,002
So the bad things they do, they
cause a lot of diseases:

12
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:39,067
tuberculosis, Lyme disease.

13
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:44,056


14
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:45,099
I mean, I could go on and on.

15
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:48,006
You know, pretty much
any time-- well,

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,079
I'll be careful here.

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,007
Whenever people talk about an
infection, it's often caused

18
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:52,074
by a bacteria.

19
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:54,035
It can also be caused
by a virus.

20
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:57,056
An infection is, in general,
anything entering you and

21
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,017
taking advantage of your body
to kind of replicate itself,

22
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,003
and in the process,
making you sick.

23
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:04,084
But bacterial infections,
let me write that down.

24
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:10,093


25
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:14,071
And this whole perception of
bacteria being a bad thing is

26
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:18,026
probably a good reason why
almost any soap you see now

27
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,049
will say antibacterial on it.

28
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:24,015


29
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:28,075
Because the makers of the soap
know that in conventional

30
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:32,009
thinking, bacteria are viewed
as a negative thing.

31
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,045
And you're like, OK,
Sal, I know where

32
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,048
you're going with this.

33
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,046
Bacteria isn't all bad.

34
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:41,001
There are some good traits
of bacteria.

35
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:45,053
For example, I could stick some
yogurt in some-- or I

36
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:48,051
could stick some bacteria in
some milk and it'll help

37
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:53,054
produce some yogurt, sometimes
spelled yoghurt.

38
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:57,070


39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,020
And that's obviously
a good thing.

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,093
It's a delicious thing to eat.

41
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:07,012
You say, well, I know I have
bacteria in my gut.

42
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:09,074
It helps me digest food.

43
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:11,056
And these are all true, but
you're like, look, you know,

44
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:16,066
on balance, I still think
bacteria is a bad thing.

45
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:19,062
I'm not going to take sides on
that debate, as I tend to

46
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:22,053
avoid taking sides on debates
in these science videos.

47
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:25,036
Maybe I'll do a whole playlist
where I do nothing but take

48
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:28,021
sides on debates, but here I
won't take any sides on that.

49
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:32,018
But I'll just point out that you
are to a large degree made

50
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,025
up of bacteria.

51
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:35,068
It's not just your gut.

52
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,033
It's not just the gut or the
yogurt you might eat or the

53
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:43,078
plaque on your teeth, which
is caused by bacteria.

54
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:46,084
It's this kind of film that's
created by bacteria that

55
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:48,091
eventually causes cavities
and whatever else.

56
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,006
And it's not just the pimples
on your face.

57
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:54,003


58
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:58,074
Bacteria actually represents
a majority of the

59
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:00,096
cells on your body.

60
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:04,093
So for every-- and this is kind
of an astounding fact.

61
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:08,021
For every one cell on the human
body, every one human

62
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:14,022
cell-- so these are all cells
that all have your DNA in them

63
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,056
and they'll have nucleuses, and
I'll talk about that in a

64
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:24,040
second-- you have 20 bacteria.

65
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,009
Now, your response there is to
say, OK, that's fair enough,

66
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,062
but these bacteria must be much
smaller than the human

67
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:34,040
cell, so it must be a very small
fraction of my mass.

68
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,006
And you're right.

69
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,088
It's not like we're mostly
bacteria by mass, although we

70
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,063
are mostly bacteria
by actual cells.

71
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,094
But even if you were to take out
all of the water in your

72
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:47,084
body, then by mass, bacteria
is going to be

73
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:53,061
roughly 10% of your mass.

74
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:57,090
So I weigh about 150 pounds,
I've got 15 pounds of bacteria

75
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,046
walking around with me.

76
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:02,068
So we always kind of think of
ourselves as like the bacteria

77
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:04,093
is riding on us, but
to a large degree,

78
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,097
we're kind of in symbiosis.

79
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:09,096
We're kind of two creatures, or
not just two creatures, two

80
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:12,053
types of creatures living
together, because I don't have

81
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,015
just one type of
bacteria on me.

82
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:16,080
I have thousands of types
of bacteria on me.

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,006
There's a huge amount of
diversity, and we're just

84
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:23,014
scratching the surface in terms
of the number and types

85
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,039
and diversity of bacteria
that exist.

86
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,098
So I've talked a lot about
bacteria, and hopefully, this

87
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:31,002
fact right here will make you
realize that they're super

88
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:33,042
important to just our
everyday existence.

89
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,074
Just to make sure we understand
the magnitude of

90
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,027
this, in a previous video, and
I looked this up again, we

91
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:43,012
have on the order of 10
to a 100 trillion

92
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,037
cells, human cells.

93
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:47,091


94
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:51,067
So for every one of these we
have 20 bacteria, we're

95
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:59,069
talking about having on the
order of 200 to 2,000 trillion

96
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,044
bacteria on us at any time.

97
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,067


98
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,085
And I'm a hygienic person.

99
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:09,006
I take showers daily,
and that's even me.

100
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,093
It's not like you can somehow
eliminate them.

101
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,050
And even more, it's not
like you even want

102
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,042
to eliminate them.

103
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,038
But that's fair enough.

104
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,031
You're probably asking, OK,
Sal, I'm convinced that

105
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,026
bacteria are important.

106
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,082
What do they actually
look like?

107
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:23,069
And they're these small
unicellular organisms. That's

108
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,058
my bacteria right there.

109
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,008
And they're different from the
cells that make up us.

110
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:32,091
When I say us, I'll throw in
all plants, animals and

111
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:35,077
funguses, fungi.

112
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:39,007
And the big difference, or the
one that people noticed first,

113
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:47,001
is that all of the Eukarya,
which includes plants, animals

114
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:52,066
and fungi, all of their DNA
is inside of a nucleus, a

115
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,067
cellular nucleus.

116
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,060
So that's the nucleus
right there.

117
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,043


118
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,012
And all of our DNA,
it's normally in

119
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,013
its chromatin form.

120
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:07,081
It's all just spread around
something like that.

121
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:11,077
In bacteria, which are what
people originally just

122
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:16,004
classify it on whether or not
you have a nucleus, in

123
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:20,054
bacteria, there is no membrane
surrounding the DNA.

124
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:25,094
So what they have is just
a big bundle of DNA.

125
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:29,092
They just have this
big bundle of DNA.

126
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:32,075
It's sometimes in a
loop all in one

127
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,024
circle called a nucleoid.

128
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:40,058


129
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:43,097
Now, whenever we look at
something, and we say, oh, we

130
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:46,062
have this thing; it doesn't;
there's this assumption that

131
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:51,013
somehow we're superior or we're
more advanced beings.

132
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:54,085
But the reality is that bacteria
have infiltrated far

133
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:58,076
more ecosystems in every part
of the planet than Eukarya

134
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:04,070
have, and there's far more
diversity in bacteria than

135
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,076
there is in Eukarya.

136
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:09,050
So when you really think about
it, these are the more

137
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,025
successful organisms. If a comet
were to hit the Earth--

138
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:19,068
God forbid-- the organisms more
likely to survive are

139
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:22,011
going to be the bacteria than
the Eukarya, than the ones

140
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:27,001
with the larger-- not always
larger, but the organisms that

141
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,070
do have this nucleus and have
membrane-bound organelles like

142
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,089
mitochondria and all that.

143
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,069
We'll talk more about
it in the future.

144
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,086
Bacteria, for the
most part, are

145
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,027
just big bags of cytoplasm.

146
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:37,016
They have their DNA there.

147
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:41,005
They do have ribosomes because
they have to code for proteins

148
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,024
just like the rest of us do.

149
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:45,004
Some of those proteins, they'll
make some from--

150
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,050
bacteria, they'll make these
flagella, which are tails that

151
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,075
allow them to move around.

152
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:51,049


153
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:54,025
They also have these
things called pili.

154
00:07:54,025 --> 00:08:00,064
Pili is plural for pilus or
pee-lus, so these pili.

155
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,094
And we'll see in a second that
the pili are kind of how the

156
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:07,097
bacteria are able to do one form
of introducing genetic

157
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:13,092
variation into their
populations.

158
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,055
Actually, I'll take a little
side note here.

159
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,087
I'm pointing out bacteria as
not having a cell wall.

160
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:20,055
There's actually another class
that used to be categorized as

161
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:23,007
type of a bacteria, and they're
called Archaea.

162
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,018
I should give them a little
bit of justice.

163
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,043
They're always kind
of the stepchild.

164
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:30,063


165
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:33,034
They used to be called Archaea
bacteria, but now people

166
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,019
realize, they've actually looked
at the DNA, because

167
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,037
when they originally looked at
these, they said, OK, these

168
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:41,078
guys also have no nucleus and a
bunch of DNA running around.

169
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:43,037
These must be a form
of bacteria.

170
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:46,000
But now that we've actually been
able to look into the DNA

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,015
of the things, we've
seen that they're

172
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,075
actually quite different.

173
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:53,015
But all of these, both bacteria
and Archaea, are

174
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,040
considered prokaryotes.

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,037


176
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,097
And this just means
no nucleus.

177
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:04,035
No nucleus, and more generally,
this is what most

178
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,074
people refer to, but more
generally, they don't have

179
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:10,029
these membrane-bound organelles
that our cells

180
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,040
have.

181
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,033
Now, the next question you might
say is, well, how do

182
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,029
these bacteria reproduce?

183
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,072
And for the most part, they do
something not completely

184
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,029
different from mitosis,
although I

185
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,041
want to call it mitosis.

186
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,089
We call it binary fission.

187
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:31,025


188
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:33,039
I'm not going to go into the
deep mechanism here, but the

189
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,042
idea is fairly simple.

190
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:37,071
I have a bacteria right here.

191
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:42,050
It replicates its DNA, so
it'll have two of these

192
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,066
nucleoids here, and then the
cytoplasm essentially splits,

193
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:49,091
or it's kind of a form of
cleavage right there.

194
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:53,032
It splits and then you
have two of them.

195
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:55,044
You have two of them then.

196
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:58,097
And then each of them, they
can code for the proteins

197
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:02,026
necessary to produce all of
their extra appendages, the

198
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,058
flagellum, which is this
long tail-like thing

199
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,002
that can help it move.

200
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,034
And it's actually fascinating
because it's operating at such

201
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:11,089
a small scale, but you can still
kind of get this motor

202
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,095
movement going on.

203
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,007
Even at this very, very small
scale, using very primitive--

204
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,012
I won't say primitive, because
that's making a value judgment

205
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:21,006
on these things, but using-- you
know, these flagellum are

206
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:23,064
on the order of several
nanometers, on the order of

207
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:25,001
tens of nanometers wide.

208
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:28,001
So you don't have a lot of atoms
to deal with, but you're

209
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:32,000
still able to get this kind of
wave-like motion that can move

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,017
the bacteria around.

211
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:36,065
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal,
in that first video on

212
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:40,012
evolution, you told me that we
see evolution every day and

213
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,000
bacteria is one example.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,010
When we use antibiotics, we
think it'll help eliminate

215
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,079
bacteria, but that one bacteria
that has some type of

216
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,065
resistance, it'll survive,
so it is more fit.

217
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:53,012
How did these guys
get variation?

218
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, the one way, and this is
the way everything can get

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,073
variation, is they can
get mutations.

220
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:02,060
And bacteria replicate so
quickly, they reproduce so

221
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,080
quickly that even if you have a
mutation that's one in every

222
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,070
thousand times, by the time you
have a million bacteria,

223
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,036
you'll have a thousand
mutations.

224
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,063
So they have mutations, but
they also have this form.

225
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:15,004
I don't want to call it sexual
reproduction, because it's not

226
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:15,085
sexual reproduction.

227
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:18,016
They don't form gametes and the
gametes don't fertilize

228
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,009
each other and then
produces a zygote.

229
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:29,084
But two bacteria can get near
each other and then one of

230
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:35,072
their piluses-- I'll
do that right here.

231
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:38,083
So the piluses are these little
structures on the side

232
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,069
of the bacteria.

233
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:42,025
They're these little
tubes, really.

234
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:46,034
One of the piluses can connect
from one bacteria to another,

235
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:49,071
and then essentially you have a
mixing of what's inside one

236
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:50,078
bacteria with another.

237
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,052
So let me draw their
nucleoids.

238
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:55,097


239
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:59,057
And then they have these other
pieces of just DNA that hangs

240
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,030
out called plasmids.

241
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,071
These are just circular
pieces of DNA.

242
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:07,046
Maybe this guy has got this
extra neat plasmid.

243
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:10,053
He got it from someplace, and
it's making him able to do

244
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:11,078
things that this guy
couldn't do.

245
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:17,003
Maybe this is the R plasmid,
which is known for making a

246
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,052
bacteria resistant to a
lot of antibiotics.

247
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,026
And what happens is, that
bacteria-- and actually,

248
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:23,052
there's mechanisms where the
bacteria know that, hey, this

249
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,085
guy doesn't have
the R plasmid.

250
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,094
And we're just beginning to
understand how it actually

251
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:30,089
works, but this will actually
replicate itself and give this

252
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,028
guy a version of
the R plasmid.

253
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,054
You could also have these
things, transposons, and I

254
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,024
should make a whole video
on this because we have

255
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,010
transposons, too.

256
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,015
But there's parts of DNA that
can jump from one part of a

257
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,087
fragment of DNA to another, and
these can also end up in

258
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:44,075
the other one.

259
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:47,023
So what you have is kind of--
it's not formal sexual

260
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,088
reproduction, but what you
essentially have is a

261
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:52,019
connection, and these bacteria
are just constantly swapping

262
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,073
DNA with each other and DNA is
jumping back and forth, so you

263
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,049
can imagine all sorts of
combinations of DNA happen

264
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:02,084
even within what you used to
call one bacterial species and

265
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:05,012
very quickly can turn to
multiple species and become

266
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,029
resistant to different things.

267
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,082
If this makes it resistant to
an antibiotic, then it can

268
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:13,014
kind of spread the information
to produce those resistant

269
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:15,085
proteins or whatever to
the other bacteria.

270
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:19,046
So this is kind of a form of
introducing variation.

271
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:23,094
And so when you transfer stuff
via this pilus, or the plural

272
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:27,065
is pili, this is called
conjugation, bacterial

273
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:28,090
conjugation.

274
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,051


275
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,063
Now, the last thing I want to
talk about, because it's

276
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,099
something that you've heard a
lot about, are antibiotics.

277
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,092
A lot of people,
they get sick.

278
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,054
The first thing they want
to get is an antibiotic.

279
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,067


280
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,083
And an antibiotic is just a
whole class of chemicals and

281
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,099
compounds, some of them
naturally derived, some of

282
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:54,080
them not, that kill bacteria.

283
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,065
So now if someone is undergoing
a surgery and they

284
00:13:58,065 --> 00:14:01,066
get a cut, instead of them
having to worry about getting

285
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:04,024
an infection, they'll take some
antibiotics to prevent

286
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:06,098
the bacteria from
growing on them.

287
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:11,011
But the question is how was this
discovered or where does

288
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,004
it come from?

289
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:16,014
It actually came from
Alexander Fleming.

290
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,000
Let me write him down.

291
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,030
Very important, because the
discovery of antibiotics is,

292
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,037
in my opinion, the most
important discovery in

293
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:23,034
medicine so far.

294
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:27,028
So, Alexander Fleming.

295
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:30,014


296
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,012
He was studying-- I think
it was Staphylococcus.

297
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:34,091
I forget which bacteria
it was, but it

298
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:36,022
was in a Petri dish.

299
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:37,076
He was using a Petri dish.

300
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,098
Let me draw a Petri dish.

301
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:40,046
There's a little circle.

302
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,078
There's some nutrients that
the bacteria can grow on.

303
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,017
So let's say the bacteria, you
know, it's growing on this

304
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,016
Petri dish.

305
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,050
And he went out, and he came
back into the room, and he saw

306
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:56,087
that some mold, some fungus had
grown on this, kind of a

307
00:14:56,087 --> 00:15:01,030
bluish-greenish fungus had grown
on the center of his

308
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,041
Petri dish.

309
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,069
And the bacteria, there was kind
of this space around it,

310
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:08,079
and the bacteria couldn't
get close to it.

311
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,058
And this mold, this fungus was
called Penicillium, the

312
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:15,073
Penicillium fungus.

313
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,067
He was able to figure
that out.

314
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,075
He took a sample of this and
then he cultured it, which

315
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:21,029
means letting it grow and
then seeing what it is.

316
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,080
This was Penicillium.

317
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,064
And he figured out that, gee,
this fungus must have

318
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:28,073
something, some chemical that
it's emitting that's

319
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:31,007
essentially killing the bacteria
around it, that's not

320
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:33,095
allowing the bacteria
to get near it.

321
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:36,077
And so that led to the discovery
of penicillin.

322
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:47,065


323
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:51,062
This was in the late
20s, 1920s.

324
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:54,041
By the time World War II came
around, now people had gunshot

325
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,088
wounds and they had to get
things amputated, whatnot, but

326
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,085
for the first time, they could
actually give people

327
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:02,097
antibiotics and not worry
about-- or they probably still

328
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:05,099
worried about it, but didn't
have to worry about this thing

329
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,066
as much as they did before.

330
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,097
And now, you know, if you have
bacteria, if you have

331
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:14,053
tuberculosis or Lyme disease or
anything, the treatment all

332
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,038
involves taking antibiotics.

333
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:18,060
And there are many, many more
types of antibiotics now

334
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,013
coming from many, many more
different sources, but the

335
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,057
general idea is the same.

336
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:24,051
You want to kill bacteria.

337
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,088
Although you don't want to kill
all bacteria, because

338
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:26,054
some of it's good.

339
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:30,019
In fact, we are made up a
whole lot of bacteria.

340
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,013
I don't know if I even
mentioned this

341
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:31,050
earlier in the video.

342
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,053
There's bacteria in our skin
that helps take up oil and

343
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:37,046
moisturizes and make our
skin nice and supple.

344
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,092
So, you know, the way you think
about it, you could view

345
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:41,000
them as negative or you could
view them as positive or you

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,004
could view them as something
in between, but the really

347
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,082
amazing thing, at least in my
mind, is that we're living in

348
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,098
symbiosis with them.

349
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:50,004
I remember I saw a Star Trek
episode once where you had

350
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:52,070
these people.

351
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,067
You had these people, and they
were some alien race.

352
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:59,042
Jean-Luc Picard had--
they ran into them.

353
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,047
They looked very humanoid
like that.

354
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,010
But it turns out-- let me draw
this human-- that they had

355
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,057
these little bugs in
their brain stem.

356
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:10,000
So they had these big insects in
their brain stem and these

357
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,030
insects started infecting the
crew of the Enterprise, and

358
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,009
they were controlling their
brains and making them act

359
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,045
weird and whatever not, and
this seemed like a very

360
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:24,006
bizarre alien concept of some
creepy-crawlie living in us

361
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,089
and affecting our brains and
affecting us in some ways.

362
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,005
But if you really think about
it, we are doing this, and

363
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:31,068
it's not just with one
little bug, it's on

364
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:32,096
the order of trillions.

365
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:36,053
Hundreds of trillions of bugs
are with us every day and they

366
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:37,053
make us us.

367
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:40,075
I mean, I'm here recording
videos along with-- or maybe I

368
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:44,003
should even say the bacteria
is recording videos or it's

369
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:46,025
maybe partially responsible
for controlling bacteria.

370
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,086
And it's known that the bacteria
can even affect our

371
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:49,091
mental state.

372
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:52,022
There's a whole bunch of
research now that certain

373
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,065
types of bacteria can
cause schizophrenia.

374
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:56,077
Actually, syphilis does.

375
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,092
Bacteria can cause depression.

376
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:03,040
Lyme disease, it's known that
when you go into later phases

377
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,066
of Lyme disease, it can affect
the mental condition of the

378
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:11,031
person who has the infection,
so it affects every part of

379
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:11,092
who we are.

380
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:15,009
I mean, it would be hard to
even talk of being a human

381
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:20,069
being without the 10% of our
mass or the 2,000 trillion

382
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:23,067
cells or 2,000 trillion
bacteria that

383
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,088
really make us us.

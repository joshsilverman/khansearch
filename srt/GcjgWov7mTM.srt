1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:08,082
I think what is probably the most misunderstood concept in all of science and, as we all know, is now turning into one of the

2
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:16,013
most contentious concepts - may be not in science, but in our popular culture - is the idea of evolution.

3
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,099
Evolution.

4
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:23,091
And whenever we hear this word - I mean: even if we don't hear in in the biological context -,

5
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:30,057
we imagine that something is changing, it is evolving, and so when people use the word evolution in

6
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:34,049
its everyday context, they think of this notion of change

7
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:39,058
that, you know, - this is going to test my drawing ability - , but they, you know:

8
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:45,067
You see an ape, bent over, we've all seen this picture at the natural museum

9
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:50,028
and he is walking hunchback like that, and his head's bent down, and

10
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:54,056
- well, I'm doing my best - that's the ape, and may be is also wearing a hat

11
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:58,061
and then they show this picture where he slowly slowly becomes more and more upright

12
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:07,000
and eventually he turns into some dude who is just walking on his way to work, also just as happy.

13
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:12,012
And now he is walking completely upright and - you know - there is some kind of implication that walking upright

14
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:17,000
is better than not walking upright, and - oh sorry - he is not having a tail anymore.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,066
Let's eliminate that. This guy does have a tail.

16
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:29,012
And let me do it in a appropriate width. You are gonna have to excuse my drawing skills.

17
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:32,034
But we've all seen this, if you have ever gone to a natural history museum.

18
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:37,043
They'll just make more and more upright apes and eventually you get to a human being.

19
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:41,098
And there is this idea that the apes somehow changed into a human being.

20
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:48,045
and I've seen this in multiple contexts and even inside of biology classes and even in the scientific community

21
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:54,053
they'll say: oh the ape evolved into the human or the ape evolved into the pre-human:

22
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,095
the guy that almost stood upright,

23
00:01:56,095 --> 00:02:00,060
you know, the guy that was a little bit hunched back, he looked a little bit like an ape

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,034
and a little bit like a human and so on and so forth.

25
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,026
And I want to be very clear here:

26
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:12,036
Even though this process did happen, that you did have creatures that over time accumulated changes,

27
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:18,003
that may be their ancestors might have looked more like this and eventually they looked more like this.

28
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:23,093
There was no active process going on, called evolution.

29
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:28,061
It was not like the ape said: Gee, I would like my kids to look more like this dude.

30
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:37,020
So somehow I'm gonna get my DNA to get enough changes to look more like this.

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,092
It is not like the DNA knew.

32
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:44,025
The DNA did'nt say: Hey, it is better to be walking than to be kind of hunched back

33
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:50,063
like an ape and you know therefore I'm going to try to somehow spontaneously change into this dude.

34
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:52,043
That is not what evolution is.

35
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:58,093
It is not like - you know - some people imagine that: May be there was a tree.

36
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:04,060
There is a tree and on that tree there is a bunch of good fruit at the top of the tree.

37
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,033
There is a bunch of good fruit at the top of the tree.

38
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:14,021
May they are apples. And then may be, you know, you have some type of cow-like creature,

39
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,059
or may be it is some type of horse-like creature.

40
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:19,036
It says: Gee, I would like to get to those apples.

41
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:23,028
And that - you know - just because they want to get to those apples, may be the next generation....

42
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:27,077
they keep trying to raise their neck, and then after generation after generation,

43
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:31,090
their necks get longer and longer and eventually they turn into giraffes.

44
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,066
That is not what evolution is and that is not what evolution implies,

45
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:40,060
although sometimes the everyday notion of the word seems to make us think that way.

46
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,076
What evolution is, and actually this is the word that I prefer to use, it's natural selection.

47
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:51,000
Natural selection, let me write that word down.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,078
Natural selection.

49
00:03:55,078 --> 00:04:03,022
And literally what it means is that in any population of living organisms you're going to have some variation.

50
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:09,002
And this is an important key-word here. Variation just means: Look, there is just some change

51
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:13,062
If you look at the kids in your school, you'll see variations.

52
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:17,062
Some people are tall, some people are short, some people have blond hair, some people have black hair.

53
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:21,014
So on and so forth. There is always variation.

54
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:23,066
and what natural selection is, is this process

55
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:30,039
that sometimes environmental factors will select for certain variations.

56
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,076
Some variation might not matter at all, but some variations matter a lot.

57
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:37,066
One example that is given in every biology book, but it really is interesting, is

58
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,013
I believe they are called the peppered moth,

59
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:45,060
and this was in pre-industrial revolution England,

60
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,060
that these moths, that some of the moths were - let me see if I can draw a moth

61
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,033
to give you the idea, you know, let me draw a couple of them,

62
00:04:56,033 --> 00:05:00,093
let me draw a few peppered moths.

63
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:05,044
A couple of peppered moths there. Let me draw one more.

64
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:09,057
So, most peppered moths there was just this variation, some of them were I guess

65
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:12,037
we could call them more peppered than others.

66
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:19,094
So, some of them might look like this, you know. No let me do another colour. Let's do white.

67
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:26,024
So it has spots like that, some of them might have looked more like that.

68
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:30,034
And of course they also had some black spots on them.

69
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:34,052
And then some of them might have been, you know,  almost - barely have any spots.

70
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,060
You just have this natural variation like you would see in any population of animals.

71
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,054
You'll see some variation in colours .

72
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:44,026
Now they were all happy, probably for thousands of years, just this natural variation.

73
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:48,050
Just this it was a non-important treat for these peppered moths

74
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,020
but then all of a sudden the industrial revolution happens in England,

75
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,093
and all of this soot gets released from all of these factories

76
00:05:56,093 --> 00:06:01,076
that are running these steam engines powered by coal, and so,

77
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:04,093
all of a sudden all of these things that once were grey or white,

78
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:08,092
for example may be some tree trunks - let me draw some tree trunks -

79
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:14,004
may there were some tree trunks that used to look like this, you know, may be it looked like a

80
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:20,034
may be it kept the, may be some tree trunks looked something like this

81
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:23,006
and a peppered moth would be pretty OK,

82
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:24,086
may there were some tree trunks were pretty dark,

83
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:27,053
but all of a sudden the industrial revolution happened,

84
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,018
everything gets covered with soot from the coal being burned and then all of a sudden all

85
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,080
the trees look like this:

86
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,038
They are completely pitch black or they are a lot darker than they were before.

87
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:42,028
Now all of a sudden you have had a major change to these moths'  environment, and you have to think:

88
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:48,000
What is going to select for these moths? Well, one thing that might get these moths are birds

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,079
and the ability of these birds to see the moths.

90
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:58,095
So all of a sudden if the environment became a lot blacker than it was before you can guess what is going to happen:

91
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:04,093
The birds are gonna see this dude a lot easier than they are gonna see this dude,

92
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:07,062
cause this dude on the black background is gonna be a lot harder to see.

93
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:09,066
And it is not like the birds won't catch this guy,

94
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:14,039
they'll catch all of them, but they're gonna catch this guy a lot more frequently.

95
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,094
So you can imagine what happens if the birds start catching these guys

96
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:22,059
before they can reproduce or may be while they are reproducing what's going to happen:

97
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:26,095
This guy, the darker dudes are going to reproduce a lot more often

98
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:32,033
and all of a sudden you're gonna have a lot more moths that look like this.

99
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:37,058
You're gonna have a lot more of these dudes. So what happened here?

100
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:43,062
Was there any design or was there any active change by any of the moths?

101
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,001
It looks like a really smart thing to do, to become black.

102
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:51,027
Your surroudings became black and you wait for a couple of generations of these moths

103
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:55,050
and all of a sudden the moths are black and you say: Wow, these moths are geniuses.

104
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:02,053
They all somehow decided to evolve into black moths in order to hide from the birds more easily.

105
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,062
But that is not what happened.

106
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:08,033
You had a bunch of them. You had a lot of variation in your peppered moth population

107
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:11,062
and what happened was that when everything turned darker and darker,

108
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:19,001
these dudes right here, and dudettes, had a lot less success in reproducing.

109
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:23,009
These guys just reproduced more and more and more and these guys got eaten up

110
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,030
before they were able to reproduce or may while they were reproducing

111
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,016
so that they couldn't produce as many offspring and then this trait became dominant.

112
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:35,055
and then the peppered moth became - you can kind of view it as a black moth.

113
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:38,084
Not you might say: OK Sal, that is one example, but I need more.

114
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,091
This is natural selection, this is perported to apply to everything,

115
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:46,060
it perports to explain why we evolved from basic bacteria

116
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,086
or may from self replicating RNA which I will talk about more in the future.

117
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:55,082
You know, I need more evidence of this - you know - I need to see it in real time.

118
00:08:55,082 --> 00:09:03,066
and the best example of  this is really the flu is really the flu.

119
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:08,093
And I'll do other videos in the future on what viruses are and how they replicate

120
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:12,039
and viruses actually are fascinating, because it is not actually clear that they are alive,

121
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:18,036
they're litterally just little buckets of DNA and sometimes RNA

122
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:22,099
which we'll learn is genetic information and they're just contained in these little viral...

123
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:27,045
these little protein containers that are these neat geometrical shapes

124
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:33,025
and that's all they are, they really don't have - you know - they are not like regular living organisms,

125
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:39,063
that actively move and that actively have metabolisms and all that.

126
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,035
What they do is they take that little DNA

127
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:43,066
and then they inject it into other things that can process it

128
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:46,044
and then they use that DNA to produce more viruses.

129
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,000
But anyway, I could,  we could do a whole series of videos on viruses,

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,080
but the flu is a virus and what happens every year is that you have a certain type of virus

131
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,027
a certain type of virus and they have some variation

132
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:06,001
and I'll just make the variation by how many dots they have.

133
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:11,034
how many dots the have and they, in fact, - let's say it is a human flu, they infect humans -

134
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:15,057
and slowly our immune systems, which we could make a whole set of videos on as well,

135
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:21,000
start to recognize the virus and are able to attack them before they can do a lot of damage.

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,018
So now you can imagine what happens, if let's say this is the current flu,

137
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:27,060
let me do all of them, they all have these little two dots

138
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,062
and that's how and we'll talk in the future about what these dots are.

139
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:34,051
and how they can be recognized, but let's say that's how our immune system recognizes them.

140
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,059
they start realizing: O, any time I get this little green dude with 2 dots on it,

141
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,047
that is not a good thing to have around.

142
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:45,085
So I am going to attack it in some way and destroy it before he infects my immune system and DNA and all the rest.

143
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:53,037
And so you have a very strong natural selection once immune systems learn what this virus is

144
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:56,077
and we'll talk more about what learning means for an immune system.

145
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:59,033
that they'll start attacking these guys, right?

146
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:03,092
But flu , you can kind of think of them as being tricky,

147
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:07,000
but they are not really tricky, they are not sensient objects.

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But what they do do: They constantly change.

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,016
so what  you have in any flu population, you're always having a little bit of change,

150
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:18,006
so may be the great majority of them have those two dots, but may be every now and then

151
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:22,063
one of them has one dot, one of them has 3 dots, and may be that is just

152
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:28,035
a random mutation, this just randomly happened, may be one in every  - I'll make up a number -

153
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:32,073
one in every million of these viruses has this only one dot instead of two dots,

154
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:37,060
but what's gonna happen as soon as the human immune system gets used to attacking

155
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,098
the virus with the two red dots, well then this guy isn't gonna have to compete with the other virus

156
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:48,059
capsules for infecting people he's going to have people's DNA all to himself.

157
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:54,026
He or she or what ever you want to call this virus, is then going to be more successfull

158
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:58,062
so by next year's flu season

159
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:02,093
when people start sneezing and are able to spread it on door knobs and whatever else again,

160
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:09,026
This guy is going to be the new flu virus. So when you see this process of every year there

161
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:15,058
is a new flu virus, that is evolution and natural selection in realtime. It is happening!

162
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:22,076
It isn't this thing that only happens over eons and eons of time. Although most of the substantial things

163
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:26,063
that we see in our lives or even in ourselves are based on these things that happened

164
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:31,004
over eons and eons of time, but it happens on a yearly basis.

165
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:33,099
Another example is if you think about antibiotics and bacteria.

166
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:37,099
Bacteria are these little cells that move around and we'll talk more about them,

167
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:43,000
they are definitely living, they have metabolisms and whatever else.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,018
And so this is just a nice thing to know: When people talk about infections

169
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:53,061
it could either be a viral infection which are these things that go and infect your DNA

170
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:58,003
and then use your cell mechanisms to reproduce or it could be a bacterial infection

171
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:00,061
which are litterally little cells and they move around

172
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,099
and they release toxins that make you sick and whatever else,

173
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:07,035
so bacteria these are what antibiotics kill.

174
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:14,017
Anti-biotics. Actually I don't think there is a hyphen: Antibiotics.

175
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:19,024
They attack bacteria, they kill them.

176
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:22,003
Now you've probaly, if you know a couple of doctors or whatever, and you say:

177
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:25,053
Hey I am sick I think I have bacterial infection, give me some antibiotics,

178
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:31,060
a responsible doctor says: No I shouldn't give you antibiotics just willy nilly, because what happens

179
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,092
is that the more anti-biotics you use, you're more likely to create versions

180
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:40,019
and I want to be very careful about the word create,

181
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,046
because you are not actively creating them, but let's say

182
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:44,045
- and let me finish my sentence -

183
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:52,066
you are very likely to help select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

184
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:57,027
Now how does that work? Now let's say this is a green

185
00:13:57,027 --> 00:14:01,003
let's say that these are all bacteria and you have bazillions of them, right?

186
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:04,038
And every now and then, you get one that is slightly different.

187
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:12,079
Now in a random population of bacteria these all will  make you equally sick

188
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,095
and this is just some random difference in the bacteria

189
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:19,079
may be on his DNA some slightly different changes happened, but whatever happened,

190
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,037
these all are the kind of bacteria that you don't want to get a lot of them in your system.

191
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:25,022
Your immune system can attack them and fight them off.

192
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:28,002
If you get a lot of them they might kill you or make you sick or whatever else.

193
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:35,086
Now, if everyone just starts using antibiotics when they are not sick or when they don't really need to

194
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:40,092
in a life or death situation, you might have an antibiotic that is really good at killing the green bacteria.

195
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:45,052
But what happens if you all of a sudden kill a lot of the green bacteria?

196
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:51,032
Well, now the blue bacteria have the whole ecosystem, that before it was  competing

197
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:57,093
with all these green dudes to get at your - get all the good stuff inside of your body, but now he is all

198
00:14:57,093 --> 00:15:03,096
alone and now he can replicate willy nilly, so now he is going to replicate willy nilly and obviously

199
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:11,062
and this is - once again - it isn't like there was any design, there was any intelligent process here that said:

200
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:16,087
Hey look, this bacteria should, - you know, I am some bacteria - said: I am going to be a little bit smarter

201
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:22,059
and design myself to resist this antibiotic threat .

202
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:30,035
No, there is just these random changes that happened and mutations in viruses and bacteria happen frequently.

203
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:35,036
And there are these random changes that happen and this might be this one in a billion change, right?

204
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:40,051
but all of a sudden if you start killing off all the people that it is competing with then this

205
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:45,094
guy can start replicating really fast and then become the dominant bacteria and then all of a sudden

206
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:53,036
that antibiotic that you had developed very carefully to destroy the green dudes is useless.

207
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:58,061
And you have this superbug. You might have heard the word superbug. That is what a superbug is.

208
00:15:58,061 --> 00:16:04,020
It's not like it designed itself somehow. It is just that we got  very good at killing its competition and so we allowed it

209
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,035
to take over and we can't kill it, because all of the drugs were just good at killing its competition.

210
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,060
And these bacteria just keep mutating and keep mutating

211
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,067
and if we use these antibiotics a little bit too heavily,

212
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:20,060
we will always be selecting for the things that won't be affected by the antibiotics.

213
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,021
Anyway, I think I have spoken long enough, but it is a fascinating fascinating topic

214
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:32,034
and I really wanted to make this my very first, my very first - I guess - video or lecture if you will on biology,

215
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:38,000
because if you really went to, you know: Biology is the study of life and we can talk about what life is

216
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,010
whether viruses are living and what not, but if you really want to study living systems,

217
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,031
you really can't make any assumptions other than natural selection.

218
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:49,099
We could go to another planet where the creatures don't have DNA

219
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:55,001
or may be they have some other type of hereditary information stored in their cells

220
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,039
or they replicate in some other way or

221
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,061
they are not even carbon based, may be they are silicon based

222
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:06,019
and if  we went to that type of a planet in order to study the biology on that planet everything else we know

223
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:10,032
about biology and about viruses and DNA would be useless.

224
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:15,002
But if we do understand this one concept, this one concept of natural selection,

225
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:20,053
that your environment will select, and you know there is no active process here,

226
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:24,027
it is just some random stuff happened and they randomly select for random changes

227
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:28,063
and  over large swats of time and these are unimaginably large swats of time

228
00:17:34,051 --> 99:59:59,000
We'll talk more about this in another video. See you soon!

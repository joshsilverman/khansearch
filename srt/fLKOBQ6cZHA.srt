1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,054


2
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:03,087
In the last video on the lungs
or the gas exchange in our

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:07,054
bodies or on the pulmonary
system, we left off with the

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:09,028
alveolar sacs.

5
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,068
Let me draw one right here.

6
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:14,040
So we have these alveolar sacs
that I talked about and

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,008
they're in these little
clumps like this.

8
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:20,046
Let me draw a couple of them
just so you get the idea.

9
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:23,062
And if you remember from the
last video, these are kind of

10
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:27,037
where air goes in through our
trachea, then that splits up

11
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:29,067
into our bronchi, and then
those split into the

12
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,073
bronchioles, and
the bronchioles

13
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,081
terminate at these alveoli.

14
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,078
So that's the alveoli.

15
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,095
These are these super-small sacs
that we talked about in

16
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,067
the last video on the
pulmonary system.

17
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,042
You might want to watch
that video if none

18
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,042
of this sounds familiar.

19
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:47,017
And then of course we have our
bronchiole that feeds into

20
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,092
this, and then that might have
branched off from another one

21
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:52,015
that feeds into another set of
alveolar sacs, but I don't

22
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,027
want to get too focused
on that.

23
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:54,052
I covered that in
the last video.

24
00:00:54,052 --> 00:01:05,062


25
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:10,045
In the last video, we saw that
air, when we breathe in, when

26
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,096
our diaphragm contracts and
makes our lungs expand and

27
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:17,037
fill up that space,
air comes in.

28
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:23,001
Air comes in and that air that
comes in is going to be-- as

29
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:27,078
we're breathing atmospheric
air-- it's going to be 21%

30
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:38,045
oxygen and it's going
to be 78% nitrogen.

31
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,012
And actually, in our atmosphere,
carbon dioxide is

32
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:43,029
actually almost a trace gas.

33
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,054
It's less than 1%.

34
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:50,068


35
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,037
So any time you breathe in on
Earth, this is what you're

36
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,076
going to get.

37
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:57,087
And we said in the last video
that you have these

38
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:01,031
capillaries, these pulmonary
capillaries that are running

39
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,042
all along the side
of these alveoli.

40
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:09,015
So let me draw those pulmonary
capillaries-- and so when they

41
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:12,038
are de-oxygenated-- so they come
here to be oxygenated.

42
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:13,069
So when they're de-oxygenated,
they might

43
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,094
look a little purplish.

44
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:21,087


45
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:25,005
And then they pick up the
oxygen from inside the

46
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:28,077
alveoli-- or the oxygen diffuses
across the membrane

47
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:32,088
of the alveoli, into these
capillaries, into these super

48
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:34,000
small tubes.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,084
And then once they do, that
makes the blood red.

50
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:40,046
I'm going to talk in a little
bit about why it becomes red.

51
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:43,071
So then it becomes red, and now
that the blood is red, it

52
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,094
has its oxygen.

53
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:46,059
The whole point is to
get the oxygen.

54
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:51,041
It's ready to go back
to the heart.

55
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,025
So that's just one little
part of it.

56
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:56,013
And we learned in the last video
that something that goes

57
00:02:56,013 --> 00:03:00,022
away from the heart-- so this is
going away from the heart--

58
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:05,044
that is an artery, a
four way artery.

59
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:09,088
And something that's going
towards the heart is a vein.

60
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:14,091
So this right here is a vein.

61
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:17,090
Now one question-- and
this actually came

62
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,091
up in the last video.

63
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,053
Someone asked-- which I think is
a very good question-- is,

64
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:27,036
gee, when we breathe in, most
of the air is nitrogen.

65
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,099
Only 21% is oxygen.

66
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,061
What happens to all that
nitrogen there?

67
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,015
How come that doesn't
go into our blood?

68
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,015
And that's actually an
excellent question.

69
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,096
So to answer that, I think that
actually helps explain

70
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,043
what's going on here.

71
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,068
Let's draw a little
bit bigger.

72
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:48,003


73
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:51,031
This is the inside of
of an alveolus.

74
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:55,056
This is its membrane right here,
super thin, almost one

75
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,096
cell thick.

76
00:03:56,096 --> 00:04:01,080
And then you have a capillary
running right next to it.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,018
Let me do that in
a neutral color.

78
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,037
So you have a capillary
that's maybe running

79
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,062
right along the surface.

80
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:14,012


81
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:18,043
And this is porous to gases
like oxygen, and nitrogen,

82
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:19,055
carbon dioxide.

83
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:22,004
And what we have here-- let's
say that this is-- so the

84
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,033
heart is over here.

85
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,087


86
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:29,001
So this is blood coming from
the heart and then this is

87
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,043
going to go back to the heart.

88
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,052
Well, the heart's
on both sides.

89
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,088
So let me write it this way.

90
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:40,052
From the heart and
to the heart.

91
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:43,055
And what you have here is--
when we're coming from the

92
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,097
heart, this is de-oxygenated
blood and it's actually going

93
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:48,039
to have a high concentration
of carbon dioxide.

94
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,094


95
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,050
I already did nitrogen
as green.

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,080
Let me do carbon dioxide
as orange.

97
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,074
There's a lot of carbon dioxide
and actually carbon

98
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:04,000
dioxide actually gets diffused
in the blood.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,027
It actually is carried in
the plasma of the blood.

100
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,058
It's not carried by red blood
cells that we're going to talk

101
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,081
about in a second.

102
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:12,026
So that's a bunch of carbon
dioxide here.

103
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:15,087
And the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the

104
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:17,057
de-oxygenated blood is going
to be higher than the

105
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:22,044
concentration of carbon dioxide
in the alveolus.

106
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:25,080
so if this is porous to carbon
dioxide, this membrane-- and

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,014
it is, these carbon dioxide
molecules are going to diffuse

108
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:35,012
into the alveolus.

109
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:40,033
Now on the other side of that--
we have oxygen here.

110
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,026
We're breathing it in.

111
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:44,055
The air is 21% oxygen so you're
actually going to have

112
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,020
a lot more oxygen than
carbon dioxide.

113
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,082
And this is de-oxygenated
blood.

114
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,068
We used all of the oxygen in our
body and we'll talk more

115
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:54,080
about that either at the end of
this video or in a future

116
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,070
video on how we use it or where
it goes in our body, but

117
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,001
there's no oxygen here so the
oxygen is going to be taken--

118
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:08,044
it's going to diffuse across
this membrane because the

119
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:10,062
concentration of
oxygen is low.

120
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:13,088
Now the question is-- so
immediately you see that as

121
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:15,094
the oxygen diffuses across
this membrane, all of a

122
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:17,045
sudden, this is oxygenated
blood ready to

123
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,026
go back to the heart.

124
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:21,094
So this transition between
artery and vein is a very

125
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:23,004
subtle thing.

126
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,099
Very clearly here, you
say that, OK, this is

127
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,043
going from the heart.

128
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:30,036
This is our vein.

129
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,044
This is going to the
heart-- sorry.

130
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,043
I always get confused.

131
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:36,093
This is going away from the
heart-- and I was looking for

132
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,004
an A and I wrote from.

133
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:41,061
This is away from the heart
so this is an artery.

134
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,032
And this is going to the heart
so this is a vein.

135
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:45,076
So you could make
the division.

136
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:47,077
You could say, OK, once it's
oxygenated, maybe we're going

137
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:50,022
back to the heart, but it's kind
of an arbitrary-- sorry.

138
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:53,006
I spelled artery wrong.

139
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,066
These are my flaws.

140
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,020
Spelling was never
my strong suit.

141
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,083
So it's hard to say where
the artery ends

142
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,082
and the vein begins.

143
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:04,031
A good demarcation is when the
carbon dioxide concentration

144
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:07,083
goes low and that the oxygen
concentration goes high.

145
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,068
That's a good time, where
we start from

146
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:13,006
the pulmonary artery.

147
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:16,018
Probably in the next video, I
will a make a very-- you'll

148
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,079
see why the pulmonary arteries
are special, because pulmonary

149
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,023
arteries coming away from the
heart have no oxygen or very

150
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:26,058
little oxygen and they have
a lot of carbon dioxide.

151
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:34,075
So pulmonary veins, which is--
it's arbitrary where the

152
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,016
artery turns into a vein.

153
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,051
Once it gets oxygenated, it's
ready to go back to the heart.

154
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:42,006
It's a pulmonary vein and
it is oxygenated.

155
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:47,032
So it has oxygenated-- and we
could write de-oxygenated.

156
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:52,027


157
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:54,089
Now the reason why I say it's
special besides the fact that

158
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:59,011
pulmonary arteries and veins go
to and from the lungs, is

159
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,039
that they're kind
of the opposite.

160
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,068
Because in the rest of the body
when we're going away

161
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:05,042
from the heart or we're talking
about arteries, you're

162
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:07,091
going to see that that's
oxygenated blood, while when

163
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:10,001
we're going away from the heart
to the lungs, that's

164
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,048
de-oxygenated blood.

165
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:14,025
Similarly in the rest of the
body, when we're going to the

166
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,056
heart, where you're to see
that that's de-oxygenated

167
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:19,022
blood, but in the pulmonary
vein, when we're going to the

168
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:23,033
heart, it's oxygenated because
the lungs are what take up the

169
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,062
carbon dioxide and give
us the oxygen.

170
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:30,031
Now I still haven't answered
that interesting question that

171
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:34,037
rose on the message board
on the last video.

172
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:37,033
What happens to the 78% of
nitrogen that's sitting here?

173
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:43,032
There's just a ton of nitrogen
over here, more than the

174
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:45,035
oxygen, a lot more than
the carbon dioxide.

175
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:48,004
What happens to all of these
nitrogen molecules?

176
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,054
And the answer is, nitrogen can
diffuse and does diffuse

177
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:56,039
into the blood, but the blood's
ability to take in

178
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,027
nitrogen isn't that high.

179
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:00,092
And you might say, well,
why is oxygen special?

180
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:03,079
Why can the blood take
up oxygen so

181
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,036
much easier than nitrogen?

182
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:09,025
And that's where the red blood
cells come into play.

183
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:09,091
Let me write this down.

184
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,051
I'll write it in red.

185
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:16,051
Red blood cells, which
are fascinating on a

186
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:20,004
whole set of levels.

187
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:23,047
What red blood cells-- these
are these cells that are

188
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:28,000
sitting in-- they're flowing
through our circulatory system

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,025
and they look kind of
like lozenges, if I

190
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,083
were to draw one.

191
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,039
They're kind of like a flattened
sphere with a little

192
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,009
divot on either side of it--
a lot like a lozenge.

193
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,073
So if I were to draw it from
the side, it might look

194
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,048
something like-- well, from the
side, it would look like

195
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,052
that and if you could see
through it, there'd be a

196
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,013
little divot on each side.

197
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:47,019
If I were to draw it at an
angle, it would look

198
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,044
something like this.

199
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:51,065


200
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:54,020
There'd be a little divot on
that side and there'd be a

201
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,096
similar divot on
the other side.

202
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,075
And red blood cells-- and I
could do a whole set of videos

203
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:03,064
just on red blood cells--
they contain hemoglobin.

204
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,025
Maybe we'll do a whole
video on hemoglobin.

205
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:11,041
The hemoglobin are these
small proteins that

206
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,033
contain four hem groups.

207
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:19,004
So inside of red blood cells,
you have millions of

208
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,075
hemoglobin proteins.

209
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:23,046
And the hemoglobin proteins--
I'll just draw them as this--

210
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,007
they have these four
heme groups.

211
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,037
And heme groups, the main
component is iron.

212
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:29,060
And that's why iron
is so important.

213
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,099
If you don't have enough iron,
you're going to have trouble

214
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:35,045
processing oxygen in your blood
and your hemoglobin

215
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,034
won't be functional enough.

216
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,035
But it has iron on it.

217
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,035
It has four of these
heme groups.

218
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:43,075
And each of these heme groups
can bond to oxygen molecules.

219
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,013
They're very good binders
of oxygen.

220
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,037
And we're going to see in a
little bit-- probably the next

221
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:51,042
video-- how they release the
oxygen, but this has tons,

222
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:56,000
this has millions of heme groups
in it and the oxygen

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,012
diffuses across the membrane
of the red blood cells and

224
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:04,097
bonds to to the heme groups
on your hemoglobin.

225
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:09,047
So because the red blood cells
have the hemoglobin inside of

226
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,037
them, they're like these sponges
for oxygen because

227
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,034
hemoglobin is so good
at taking in oxygen.

228
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:17,016
So the red blood cells are able
to essentially suck up

229
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:19,071
all of the oxygen out
of the plasma.

230
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:22,029
The plasma we can view as just
the general fluid of the

231
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,050
blood, not including the
red blood cells.

232
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,032
So the red blood cell
here isn't so red.

233
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:32,037
And the reason-- and this is the
key point-- the reason why

234
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:35,061
it's not so red-- maybe we had
a red blood cell over here--

235
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,019
let me make it clear.

236
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,045
Carbon dioxide for
the most part is

237
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:41,038
traveling within the plasma.

238
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:44,063
It gets absorbed into the actual
fluid and I'll talk

239
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,050
about it in a future video.

240
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,059
It's actually in a slightly
different form.

241
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,082
It's as carbonic acid and that's
actually a key point

242
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:54,003
for how the plasma knows where
to dump the oxygen, but I'll

243
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:55,072
talk about that in
a future video.

244
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:59,053
But over here, this red blood
cell has a bunch of hemoglobin

245
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,084
proteins in it, but those
hemoglobin proteins have

246
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,019
dumped their oxygen.

247
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,025
And it actually turns out it's
the hemoglobin-- so with

248
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,008
oxygen, hemoglobin looks red.

249
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,098


250
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,065
It reflects red light.

251
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:19,035
When it doesn't have oxygen,
hemoglobin does not look red.

252
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:23,019
It looks kind of purplish,
bluish, darkish-- something.

253
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,087
And that's why in most of your
body, your veins that have

254
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:31,076
de-oxygenated red blood cells
look kind of bluish.

255
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,037
And the reason why it changes
color is that when the oxygen

256
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:37,086
bonds to the hem sites on the
hemoglobin, it actually

257
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:40,048
changes the entire confirmation,
the entire

258
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:41,065
structure of the protein.

259
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,015
We've see that multiple times.

260
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:45,095
The whole protein folds in
such a way that all of a

261
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:49,034
sudden, instead of purplish or
dark light being reflected,

262
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,069
now red light is reflected.

263
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:54,012
And that's why red blood cells
will become red once they take

264
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:54,091
the oxygen.

265
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:56,024
But I'm going on a tangent.

266
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,072
The whole point here is saying,
why we taking up so

267
00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:01,030
much more oxygen than nitrogen,
given that there's

268
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,025
less oxygen in the atmosphere
than nitrogen?

269
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:06,072
And the key is these
red blood cells.

270
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:09,025
These red blood cells have these
millions of hemoglobin

271
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,027
proteins inside of them and they
take them up and they sop

272
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,027
up all of the oxygen
out of the plasma.

273
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:23,087
Actually, they sop about
98.5% of the oxygen.

274
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:25,055
So these red blood cells are
just traveling and they're

275
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,044
going to go back to the heart.

276
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:29,066
They are what make
our blood red.

277
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:32,000
So you have this thing,
hemoglobin, that's sitting in

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,076
red blood cells.

279
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,037
It's sopping up all
the oxygen.

280
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:37,028
So it keeps the oxygen
concentration and the actual

281
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:38,061
plasma low.

282
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,075
You have nothing like
that for nitrogen.

283
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:43,035
There is no cell that's sopping
up the nitrogen.

284
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:46,027
Nitrogen does not bond
to hemoglobin.

285
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:49,002
So that's why oxygen
is taken up so

286
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,099
much better than nitrogen.

287
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:55,069
It's a very interesting question
because if you just

288
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,070
think about how much nitrogen
is, it's kind of a very

289
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,062
natural idea.

290
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:02,063
Now I want to focus a little
bit on the red blood cell

291
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:05,084
itself because it's
fascinating.

292
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:08,024
In the video on the structure
of the cell, I start off

293
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,001
saying, all cells have
a membrane and

294
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,019
they all have DNA.

295
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:22,056
Now, the fascinating thing about
a red blood cell-- I

296
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:26,098
already said it has millions
of hemoglobin molecules or

297
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,058
proteins inside of it.

298
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:29,095
The fascinating thing
about a red blood

299
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:32,012
cell-- it has no nucleus.

300
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:34,075


301
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:38,020
And no DNA.

302
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,054
This is mind boggling when
I first found out.

303
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,098
I was like, well, why
is it a cell?

304
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,086
Is it really even
a living thing?

305
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,099
And it turns out when
it's growing,

306
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,080
it does have a nucleus.

307
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,030
All cells need a nucleus with
DNA in order to generate the

308
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,052
proteins that build it up,
in order to exist and

309
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:59,069
structurally make itself the way
it needs to be made, but

310
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:02,082
the whole point of a red blood
cell is to contain as much

311
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:05,002
hemoglobin as possible.

312
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,049
And so you can imagine, this
is actually a favorable

313
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:11,020
evolutionary trait, that as red
blood cells are ready to

314
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,076
go into business, you've built
the whole structure, they

315
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:16,023
actually get rid of
their nucleus.

316
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:19,044
They actually push their nucleus
out of the cell and

317
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,095
the whole reason why that's
beneficial is, that's more

318
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:24,053
space for hemoglobin.

319
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:33,027


320
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:36,073
Because the more hemoglobin you
have, the more oxygen you

321
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:37,061
can take up.

322
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:42,012
And I can do a ton of videos
on hemoglobin and all of

323
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:44,003
that-- and actually, I'm going
to do a lot more on the

324
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,037
circulatory system so don't
worry about that, but I want

325
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:49,087
to go over one other really
interesting thing about

326
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,055
hemoglobin.

327
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,087
We already talked about
red blood cells.

328
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:54,007
I think it's fascinating that
they actually don't have a

329
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,037
nucleus in their mature form.

330
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,073
They actually have
very short lives.

331
00:15:56,073 --> 00:16:00,036
They live maybe 80, 120 days
so they're not these long

332
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:03,072
lived cells-- so it's almost
a philosophical question.

333
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:07,025
Are are they still alive once
they've lost their DNA or are

334
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:11,041
they just vessels for oxygen
that aren't really alive

335
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,021
because they aren't regenerating
and producing

336
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,052
their own DNA?

337
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,098
So actually, instead of going
into the hemoglobin discussion

338
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:19,038
right now, I'll leave you
there in this video.

339
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,075
I realize I've been making
20-minute videos where my goal

340
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,080
is really to make
ten-minute ones.

341
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,005
So I'll leave you here and in
the next video, we'll talk

342
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:28,059
more about hemoglobin and
the circulatory system.

343
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,015

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,075


2
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:04,003
I've talked a lot about the
importance of hemoglobin in

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,012
our red blood cells so I thought
I would dedicate an

4
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,033
entire video to hemoglobin.

5
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:11,021
One-- because it's important,
but also it explains a lot

6
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:15,041
about how the hemoglobin-- or
the red blood cells, depending

7
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,010
on what level you want to
operate-- know, and I have to

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,005
use know in quotes.

9
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:22,089
These aren't sentient beings,
but how do they know when to

10
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:26,005
pick up the oxygen and when
to drop off the oxygen?

11
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,078
So this right here, this is
actually a picture of a

12
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,071
hemoglobin protein.

13
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:36,024


14
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,078
It's made up of four
amino acid chains.

15
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,042
That's one of them.

16
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,077
Those are the other two.

17
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:44,000
We're not going to go into the
detail of that, but these look

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,020
like little curly ribbons.

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,029
If you imagine them, they're a
bunch of molecules and amino

20
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:49,021
acids and then they're curled
around like that.

21
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:52,059
So this on some level
describes its shape.

22
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:57,014
And in each of those groups or
in each of those chains, you

23
00:00:57,014 --> 00:01:03,010
have a heme group
here in green.

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,042
That's where you get the
hem in hemoglobin from.

25
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,087
You have four heme groups and
the globins are essentially

26
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:11,015
describing the rest of it-- the
protein structures, the

27
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:12,031
four peptide chains

28
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,009
Now, this heme group-- this
is pretty interesting.

29
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,085
It actually is a porphyrin
structure.

30
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:21,079
And if you watch the video on
chlorophyll, you'd remember a

31
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,089
porphyrin structure, but at
the very center of it, in

32
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:26,067
chlorophyll, we had a magnesium
ion, but at the very

33
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:34,043
center of hemoglobin, we have an
iron ion and this is where

34
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,071
the oxygen binds.

35
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:38,081
So on this hemoglobin, you have
four major binding sites

36
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,037
for oxygen.

37
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:41,054
You have right there, maybe
right there, a little bit

38
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:45,065
behind, right there,
and right there.

39
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:51,051
Now why is hemoglobin-- oxygen
will bind very well here, but

40
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,043
hemoglobin has a several
properties that one, make it

41
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:57,071
really good at binding oxygen
and then also really good at

42
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:01,023
dumping oxygen when it
needs to dump oxygen.

43
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:04,090
So it exhibits something called
cooperative binding.

44
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,099


45
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:14,027
And this is just the principle
that once it binds to one

46
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:18,044
oxygen molecule-- let's say
one oxygen molecule binds

47
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:22,071
right there-- it changes the
shape in such a way that the

48
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,075
other sites are more likely
to bind oxygen.

49
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:32,044
So it just makes it-- one
binding makes the other

50
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:33,069
bindings more likely.

51
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:42,081


52
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,030
Now you say, OK, that's fine.

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,012
That makes it a very good oxygen
acceptor, when it's

54
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:52,015
traveling through the pulmonary
capillaries and

55
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:54,031
oxygen is diffusing
from the alveoli.

56
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:57,059
That makes it really good at
picking up the oxygen, but how

57
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:00,041
does it know when to
dump the oxygen?

58
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,068
This is an interesting
question.

59
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:05,022


60
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:10,005
It doesn't have eyes or some
type of GPS system that says,

61
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:14,005
this guy's running right now and
so he's generating a lot

62
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:17,071
of carbon dioxide right now in
these capillaries and he needs

63
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,028
a lot of oxygen in these
capillaries surrounding his

64
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:21,028
quadriceps.

65
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,009
I need to deliver oxygen.

66
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,084
It doesn't know it's
in the quadraceps.

67
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:28,046
How does the hemoglobin know to
let go of the oxygen there?

68
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:32,050
And that's a byproduct of what
we call allosteric inhibition,

69
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,009
which is a very fancy word,
but the concept's actually

70
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,034
pretty straightforward.

71
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:40,084


72
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:44,087
When you talk about allosteric
anything-- it's often using

73
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:48,016
the context of enzymes-- you're
talking about the idea

74
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,046
that things bind
to other parts.

75
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,055
Allo means other.

76
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,025
So you're binding to other parts
of the protein or the

77
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:59,065
enzyme-- and enzymes are just
proteins-- and it affects the

78
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:02,031
ability of the protein
or the enzyme to do

79
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,075
what it normally does.

80
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:07,043
So hemoglobin is allosterically
inhibited by

81
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:13,050
carbon dioxide and by protons.

82
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,023
So carbon dioxide can bond
to other parts of the

83
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,054
hemoglobin-- I don't
know the exact

84
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:19,049
spots-- and so can protons.

85
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,063
So remember, acidity
just means a high

86
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,093
concentration of protons.

87
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:25,075
So if you're in an acidic
environment, protons can bond.

88
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,047
Maybe I'll do the protons
in this pink color.

89
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:31,097
Protons-- which are just
hydrogen without electrons,

90
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:36,019
right-- protons can bond to
certain parts of our protein

91
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,037
and it makes it harder for them
to hold onto the oxygen.

92
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:42,073
So when you're in the presence
of a lot of carbon dioxide or

93
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:46,074
an acidic environment, this
thing is going to let go of

94
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,073
its oxygen.

95
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:50,064
And it just happens to be that
that's a really good time to

96
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,068
let go of your oxygen.

97
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:55,033
Let's go back to this
guy running.

98
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,089
There's a lot of activity in
these cells right here in his

99
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,045
quadriceps.

100
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:03,042
They're releasing a lot of
carbon dioxide into the

101
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,031
capillaries.

102
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:09,038
At that point, they're going
from arteries into veins and

103
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,093
they need a lot of oxygen, which
is a great time for the

104
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,089
hemoglobin to dump
their oxygen.

105
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:17,056
So it's really good that
hemoglobin is allosterically

106
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:19,077
inhibited by carbon dioxide.

107
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:22,049
Carbon dioxide joins on
certain parts of it.

108
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,072
It starts letting go of its
oxygen, that's exactly where

109
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,069
in the body the oxygen
is needed.

110
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,036
Now you're saying, wait.

111
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,002
What about this acidic
environment?

112
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,035
How does this come into play?

113
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,099
Well, it turns out that most
of the carbon dioxide is

114
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,025
actually disassociated.

115
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,043
It actually disassociates.

116
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,097
It does go into the plasma, but
it actually gets turned

117
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:40,041
into carbonic acid.

118
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,058
So I'll just write a little
formula right here.

119
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:49,087
So if you have some CO2 and you
mix it with the water-- I

120
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:53,006
mean, most of our blood, the
plasma-- it's water.

121
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:54,087
So you take some carbon dioxide,
you mix it with

122
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:59,095
water, and you have it in the
presence of an enzyme-- and

123
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:02,015
this enzyme exists in
red blood cells.

124
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,093
It's called carbonic
anhydrase.

125
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:10,088


126
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:14,031
A reaction will occur--
essentially you'll end up with

127
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:16,058
carbonic acid.

128
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:17,083
We have H2CO3.

129
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,062


130
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,025
It's all balanced.

131
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:24,067
We have three oxygens, two
hydrogens, one carbon.

132
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:27,069
It's called carbonic acid
because it gives away hydrogen

133
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,075
protons very easily.

134
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:34,001
Acids disassociate into their
conjugate base and hydrogen

135
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,019
protons very easily.

136
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:41,019
So carbonic acid disassociates
very easily.

137
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,033
It's an acid, although I'll
write in some type of an

138
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,091
equilibrium right there.

139
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,050
If any of this notation really
confuses you or you want more

140
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,068
detail on it, watch some of the
chemistry videos on acid

141
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:54,018
disassociation and equilibrium
reactions and all of that, but

142
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:57,054
it essentially can give away
one of these hydrogens, but

143
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,093
just the proton and it keeps the
electron of that hydrogen

144
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:03,020
so you're left with a hydrogen
proton plus-- well, you gave

145
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,069
away one of the hydrogens so
you just have one hydrogen.

146
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,068
This is actually a
bicarbonate ion.

147
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:11,047


148
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,075
But it only gave away the
proton, kept the electron so

149
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,012
you have a minus sign.

150
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:18,089
So all of the charge adds up to
neutral and that's neutral

151
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,069
over there.

152
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,093
So if I'm in a capillary
of the leg-- let me see

153
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,063
if I can draw this.

154
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:28,088
So let's say I'm in the
capillary of my leg.

155
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:30,064
Let me do a neutral color.

156
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:32,041
So this is a capillary
of my leg.

157
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,042
I've zoomed in just one
part of the capillary.

158
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,007
It's always branching off.

159
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:41,049
And over here, I have a bunch
of muscle cells right here

160
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:47,000
that are generating a lot
of carbon dioxide

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,057
and they need oxygen.

162
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,043
Well, what's going to happen?

163
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:53,033
Well, I have my red blood
cells flowing along.

164
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:57,075
It's actually interesting--
red blood cells-- their

165
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:01,027
diameter's 25% larger than
the smallest capillaries.

166
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,037
So essentially they get squeezed
as they go through

167
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:06,055
the small capillaries, which a
lot of people believe helps

168
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:10,081
them release their contents and
maybe some of the oxygen

169
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:11,087
that they have in them.

170
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:14,000
So you have a red blood cell
that's coming in here.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,018
It's being squeezed through
this capillary right here.

172
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:22,012
It has a bunch of hemoglobin--
and when I say a bunch, you

173
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:25,080
might as well know right now,
each red blood cell has 270

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,024
million hemoglobin proteins.

175
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:32,016
And if you total up the
hemoglobin in the entire body,

176
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:38,008
it's huge because
we have 20 to 30

177
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,066
trillion red blood cells.

178
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:45,017


179
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:49,082
And each of those 20 to 30
trillion red blood cells have

180
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:55,033
270 million hemoglobin
proteins in them.

181
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,087
So we have a lot
of hemoglobin.

182
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,040
So anyway, that was a little
bit of a-- so actually, red

183
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,024
blood cells make up roughly
25% of all of the

184
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,008
cells in our body.

185
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,073
We have about 100 trillion
or a little bit

186
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:05,091
more, give or take.

187
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,090
I've never sat down
and counted them.

188
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,098
But anyway, we have 270 million
hemoglobin particles

189
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:14,095
or proteins in each red blood
cell-- explains why the red

190
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,010
blood cells had to shed their
nucleuses to make space for

191
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,037
all those hemoglobins.

192
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,050
They're carrying oxygen.

193
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,073
So right here we're dealing
with-- this

194
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,040
is an artery, right?

195
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,061
It's coming from the heart.

196
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,087
The red blood cell is going in
that direction and then it's

197
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,010
going to shed its oxygen
and then it's

198
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,008
going to become a vein.

199
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:38,063
Now what's going to happen is
you have this carbon dioxide.

200
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:41,038
You have a high concentration
of carbon dioxide in the

201
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,087
muscle cell.

202
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:45,052
It eventually, just by diffusion
gradient, ends up--

203
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:52,076
let me do that same color-- ends
up in the blood plasma

204
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:55,075
just like that and some of it
can make its way across the

205
00:09:55,075 --> 00:10:00,022
membrane into the actual
red blood cell.

206
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,067
In the red blood cell, you have
this carbonic anhydrase

207
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:07,076
which makes the carbon dioxide
disassociate into-- or

208
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:09,089
essentially become carbonic
acid, which

209
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,037
then can release protons.

210
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:14,070


211
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,070
Well, those protons, we just
learned, can allosterically

212
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,025
inhibit the uptake of oxygen
by hemoglobin.

213
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,003
So those protons start bonding
to different parts and even

214
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,064
the carbon dioxide that hasn't
been reacted with-- that can

215
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:30,084
also allosterically inhibit
the hemoglobin.

216
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:32,062
So it also bonds
to other parts.

217
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:36,073
And that changes the shape of
the hemoglobin protein just

218
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:39,037
enough that it can't hold onto
its oxygens that well and it

219
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,063
starts letting go.

220
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:43,023
And just as we said we had
cooperative binding, the more

221
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:46,017
oxygens you have on, the better
it is at accepting

222
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:47,048
more-- the opposite happens.

223
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:49,072
When you start letting go of
oxygen, it becomes harder to

224
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:50,053
retain the other ones.

225
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:52,025
So then all of the
oxygens let go.

226
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,040
So this, at least in my mind,
it's a brilliant, brilliant

227
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,090
mechanism because the oxygen
gets let go just where it

228
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,073
needs to let go.

229
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:05,075
It doesn't just say, I've
left an artery and

230
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,098
I'm now in a vein.

231
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,004
Maybe I've gone through some
capillaries right here and I'm

232
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,008
going to go back to a vein.

233
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,091
Let me release my oxygen--
because then it would just

234
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:14,017
release the oxygen willy-nilly
throughout the body.

235
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:17,011
This system, by being
allosterically inhibited by

236
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,057
carbon dioxide and an acidic
environment, it allows it to

237
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:23,073
release it where it is most
needed, where there's the most

238
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:28,057
carbon dioxide, where
respiration is occurring most

239
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:29,087
vigorously.

240
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:32,054
So it's a fascinating,
fascinating scheme.

241
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:34,053
And just to get a better
understanding of it, right

242
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:37,051
here I have this little chart
right here that shows the

243
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:40,074
oxygen uptake by hemoglobin or
how saturated it can be.

244
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,055
And you might see this in maybe
your biology class so

245
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,059
it's a good thing
to understand.

246
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,088
So right here, we have on the
x-axis or the horizontal axis,

247
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:51,045
we have the partial pressure
of oxygen.

248
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:54,017
And if you watched the chemistry
lectures on partial

249
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:56,035
pressure, you know that partial
pressure just means,

250
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:58,099
how frequently are you being
bumped into by oxygen?

251
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:03,048
Pressure is generated by gases
or molecules bumping into you.

252
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,029
It doesn't have to be gas,
but just molecules

253
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,030
bumping into you.

254
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,038
And then the partial pressure
of oxygen is the amount of

255
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,030
that that's generated
by oxygen molecules

256
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,099
bumping into you.

257
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,037
So you can imagine as you go
to the right, there's just

258
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:17,015
more and more oxygen around so
you're going to get more and

259
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,092
more bumped into by oxygen.

260
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:21,050
So this is just essentially
saying, how much oxygen is

261
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,059
around as you go to
the right axis?

262
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,054
And then the vertical axis tells
you, how saturated are

263
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:29,014
your hemoglobin molecules?

264
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:33,061
This 100% would mean all of the
heme groups on all of the

265
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:37,098
hemoglobin molecules or proteins
have bound to oxygen.

266
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:41,027
Zero means that none have. So
when you have an environment

267
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,062
with very little oxygen-- and
this actually shows the

268
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:48,005
cooperative binding-- so let's
say we're just dealing with an

269
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:49,096
environment with very
little oxygen.

270
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:53,040
So once a little bit of oxygen
binds, then it makes it even

271
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,020
more likely that more and
more oxygen will bind.

272
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,084
As soon as a little-- that's why
the slope is increasing.

273
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:01,022
I don't want to go into algebra
and calculus here, but

274
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,089
as you see, we're kind
of flattish, and

275
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,054
then the slope increases.

276
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:06,099
So as we bind to some oxygen,
it makes it more likely that

277
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,060
we'll bind to more.

278
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,041
And at some point, it's hard for
oxygens to bump just right

279
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,073
into the right hemoglobin
molecules, but you can see

280
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:17,003
that it kind of accelerates
right around here.

281
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:21,062
Now, if we have an acidic
environment that has a lot of

282
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:24,035
carbon dioxide so that the
hemoglobin is allosterically

283
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,019
inhibited, it's not going
to be as good at this.

284
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,083
So in an acidic environment,
this curve for any level of

285
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,062
oxygen partial pressure or any
amount of oxygen, we're going

286
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,099
to have less bound hemoglobin.

287
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:39,013
Let me do that in a
different color.

288
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:41,011
So then the curve would
look like this.

289
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:46,092
The saturation curve will
look like this.

290
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:51,020


291
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,036
So this is an acidic
environment.

292
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:57,040
Maybe there's some carbon
dioxide right here.

293
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:06,029
So the hemoglobin is being
allosterically inhibited so

294
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:09,082
it's more likely to dump the
oxygen at this point.

295
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,029
So I don't know.

296
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,025
I don't know how exciting you
found that, but I find it

297
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:15,045
brilliant because it really is
the simplest way for these

298
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,048
things to dump their oxygen
where needed.

299
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:22,008
No GPS needed, no robots needed
to say, I'm now in the

300
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,061
quadriceps and the
guy is running.

301
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,041
Let me dump my oxygen.

302
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,040
It just does it naturally
because it's a more acidic

303
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,017
environment with more
carbon dioxide.

304
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:31,012
It gets inhibited and then the
oxygen gets dumped and ready

305
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:33,007
to use for respiration.

306
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:33,047

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,039
Most cells in the human body
just go about their business

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:06,032
on a daily basis in a fairly
respectable way.

4
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:07,096
Let's say that I have
some cell here.

5
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:12,025
This could be maybe a skin cell
or really any cell in any

6
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,048
tissue in the body.

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,037
As that tissue is growing or
it's replacing dead cells, the

8
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:21,007
cells will experience mitosis
and replicate themselves, make

9
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,032
perfect copies of each other.

10
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:25,067
And then those two maybe will
experience mitosis, and then

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,058
if they realize that, gee, you
know, it's getting a little

12
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:29,032
bit crowded.

13
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,083
There are other cells
in my neighborhood.

14
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:35,031


15
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,088
They'll recognize that, and say,
you know, I'm going to

16
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:38,018
stop growing a little bit.

17
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,056
That's called contact
inhibition.

18
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:43,000


19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,028
And so they'll just
start growing.

20
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:49,067
And then let's say one of them
experiences a little defect,

21
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:53,079
and he says, you know what, gee,
something's a little bit

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,072
wrong with me.

23
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:58,027
I, the cell, recognize this in
myself, and the cells will

24
00:00:58,027 --> 00:00:59,025
actually kill themselves.

25
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,077
That's how good of cellular
citizens they are.

26
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:07,006
They'll kind of make way for
other healthy cells.

27
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,084
So this guy might even kill
himself if he realizes that

28
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,092
there's something
wrong with him.

29
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:13,010
There's actually a cellular
mechanism that does that

30
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,017
called apoptosis.

31
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:16,025
And I want to make
this very clear.

32
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:19,054
This isn't some type of outside
influence on the cell.

33
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,085
The cell itself recognizes that
it's somehow damaged and

34
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:26,054
it just destroys itself,
so apoptosis.

35
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,087
So that's the regular
circumstance even when there

36
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,000
is a mutation.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,059
And just to give you an idea,
even if mutations are

38
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,087
relatively infrequent.

39
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,078
And I don't know the exact
frequencies at

40
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,093
which mutations occur.

41
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:39,078
I suspect it's of different
frequencies in different types

42
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:40,064
of tissues.

43
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:46,000
There are on the order
of 100 billion.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,082
Let me do it in a
different color.

45
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:54,015
There are on the order of 100
billion new cells in the human

46
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:57,075
body per day.

47
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,028
So even if a mutation only
occurs one in a million times,

48
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:05,085
you're still dealing with
roughly 100,000 mutations, and

49
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:09,016
maybe most of the mutations,
maybe they're just some little

50
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,097
random things that don't
really do a lot.

51
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,099
But if the mutations are a
little bit more severe, the

52
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,047
cell will recognize it
and destroy itself.

53
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,088
And I want to make a very
clear point here.

54
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:23,050
I'm talking about the cells of
the body or most of the body.

55
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,090
This could be the cells in my
eye or the cells in my brain

56
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,071
or the cells on my leg.

57
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:32,009
These aren't my germ cells.

58
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:35,043
So these mutations, even if the
cell survives, will not be

59
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,025
passed on to my offspring.

60
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,038
That's an entirely different
discussion when

61
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:41,009
we talk about meiosis.

62
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,025
These are all my body cells and
they're replicating, and

63
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:48,050
we've gone over this
with mitosis.

64
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,047
So any mutations here, they'll
either do nothing, or the

65
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:54,059
cells might malfunction a little
bit, or the cells might

66
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:57,002
hurt themselves or hurt me,
but they're not going to

67
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,043
affect my offspring.

68
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,022
And I want to make that
point very clear.

69
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,038
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal,
100 billion new cells a day?

70
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:07,078
That must mean like every cell
in my body has created, well

71
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:09,083
that just gives you an idea of
how many cells we have. We

72
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,016
actually have on the order of,
and you know it's obviously

73
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:16,000
not an exact number, but
actually in the human body,

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,093
there's on the order of
100 trillion cells.

75
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:25,061
And if you look at it that way,
you say on average, one

76
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:28,059
thousandth of your cells
replicate each day, but the

77
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:31,069
reality is some cells don't
replicate that frequently at

78
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,094
all and some cells replicate
much more frequently.

79
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:38,047
Just to take a little side note
here, this gives you an

80
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:42,003
appreciation, I think, for the
complexity of the human body.

81
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:45,093
I mean we think of our own
world economy and world

82
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:49,046
society as so complex, it's made
up of 6 billion humans.

83
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:53,046
We're made up of 100
trillion cells.

84
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:55,078
Let me rewrite 100 trillion
in billions.

85
00:03:55,078 --> 00:04:03,056
100 trillion can be rewritten
as 100,000 billion cells.

86
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:09,043
And each one of those 100,000
billion cells are these huge--

87
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:12,000
I know I shouldn't use the word
huge-- but they're these

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,088
complex ecosystems in and of

89
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,095
themselves with their nucleuses.

90
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:20,011
And we'll talk about all the
different organelles they

91
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:23,012
have, and we talked about
cellular replication, DNA

92
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,013
replication and how the
cell replicates.

93
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:28,018
So these things aren't jokes
and they have all of these

94
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,057
complex membranes that take
things into them.

95
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:34,014
They are creatures to
themselves, but they live in

96
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:39,055
this complex environment or
society that is each of us.

97
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:42,001
So that's just a side note just
to appreciate how large

98
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,079
and how complex we are.

99
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,002
But you can imagine, and this
is how I got off on this

100
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:51,008
tangent, if we're making on the
order of 100 billion new

101
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:54,013
cells every day, you're going
to have a lot of mutations,

102
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:56,081
and maybe some of the mutations,
you know I said

103
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,002
some of them don't
do anything.

104
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,052
Some of them, the cell
recognizes that the cell is

105
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:05,013
just going to be kind of dead
weight so the cell kind of

106
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,024
eliminates itself.

107
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,037
But every now and then, you have
mutations where the cell

108
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:13,022
doesn't eliminate itself and
it also deforms the cell.

109
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,077
So when you have that, let's
say I have some cell here.

110
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:20,027
I have some cell and it's
got some mutation.

111
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:27,031
I'll do that mutation with
a little x right here.

112
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,055
That's in its DNA.

113
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:30,018
Maybe it's got a couple
of mutations.

114
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:32,050
So one of the mutations keeps
it from experiencing

115
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,045
apoptosis, or destroying itself,
and maybe one of the

116
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,008
mutations makes it replicate
a little bit

117
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,061
faster than its neighbors.

118
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:43,033
So this cell, through mitosis,
it makes a bunch of copies of

119
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:48,012
itself or a ton of
copies of itself.

120
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:54,049
And this kind of body of cells
that essentially has a defect,

121
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:58,006
they're all from one original
cell that kept duplicating and

122
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:01,005
then those duplicating, but all
these are defective cells.

123
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:05,091
If you were to look at them
compared to the tissue around

124
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,087
it, it would look abnormal
in some way.

125
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,085
Maybe it wouldn't function
properly.

126
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,010
This is called a neoplasm.

127
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,088


128
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:20,091
Now, a lot of neoplasms,
well they don't have to

129
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,091
form a body like this.

130
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:24,056
Sometimes they might somehow
circulate in the body, but

131
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:28,019
most of the time they form
this kind of big lump.

132
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,007
And if they get large enough,
they're noticeable.

133
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,023
And that's when we
call it a tumor.

134
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:37,099
So if this is actually a lump
of kind of differentiated

135
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,029
tissue that's definitely
abnormal, that's

136
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,073
what you call a tumor.

137
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:45,036
So the term neoplasm and
tumor are often used

138
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,006
interchangeably.

139
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:50,089
Tumor is the word we use more
in our everyday vocabulary.

140
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:55,089
Now, if this lump just kind of
grows to a certain size, it's

141
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,063
just there, it doesn't really
do anything dangerous, it's

142
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:02,047
not replicating out
of control.

143
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,037
I guess it's not replicating
a lot faster than its

144
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,068
neighboring cells and it's
just hanging out, maybe

145
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:10,033
growing a little bit, but not in
any significant way harming

146
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:13,033
our environment, we
call that a benign

147
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,077
tumor or a benign neoplasm.

148
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:17,042


149
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,052
And benign essentially
means harmless.

150
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,015
Benign tumor.

151
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:23,081
That means that's good.

152
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,061
You want to hear that.

153
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:28,037
If you got a lump-- God forbid
you have a lump either way--

154
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,099
but if you do and it's a benign
tumor, that means that

155
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,068
lump, it can kind of stick
around, no damage done.

156
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:38,039
But if these DNA mutations, and
maybe some of these are,

157
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,039
it is benign, but maybe one of
the benign ones has another

158
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,025
mutation in it that starts
making it grow like crazy.

159
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:48,050


160
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,031
And not only does it
grow like crazy,

161
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,077
but it becomes invasive.

162
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:55,032
And invasive means that
it doesn't care what's

163
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:56,062
going on around it.

164
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:58,048
It just wants to infiltrate
everything.

165
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:02,007
So let's say that guy
grows like crazy.

166
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:03,043
Let me do it in a
different color.

167
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:05,069
And he starts infiltrating
other

168
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,027
tissue, so he's invasive.

169
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:15,081
So super growth,
he's invasive.

170
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:17,056
So he doesn't care
what's going on.

171
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,043
He's all of a sudden turned into
some type of a cellular

172
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,042
psychopath.

173
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,055
And even worse, his descendants,
it's not just one

174
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:23,098
cell anymore.

175
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,051
He just keeps duplicating and
passing on this kind of broken

176
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,075
genetic information that makes
it want to replicate.

177
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:36,061
And then maybe there could be
more and more things that

178
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:41,051
break down in its I guess
offspring or the DNA that

179
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,012
comes from its replications.

180
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:46,038
And actually, that's a good
likelihood, because the same

181
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:50,073
parts of its DNA that broke
down, some of the DNA that

182
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:53,005
broke down in this guy, some
of the mutations might have

183
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,003
actually hurt the DNA
replication scheme, so that

184
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,024
mutations become
more frequent.

185
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:02,065
So more frequent mutations.

186
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:06,034
So as these replicate, more and
more mutations appear, and

187
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,071
then maybe eventually one of
the mutations appears that

188
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:13,000
allows these cells to break off
and then travel to other

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,025
parts of the body.

190
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,073


191
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:19,032
And then those parts of the body
start to take over and

192
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,019
start taking over all
of the cells.

193
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,050
And this process is called the
cell has-- this is one of the

194
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,076
hardest words for me to say,
something wrong with my

195
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,097
brain-- but the cell
has metastasized.

196
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:35,085


197
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:38,071
You might have heard the word
metastasis, and that's just

198
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:42,047
the notion of these run amok
cells all of a sudden being

199
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,080
able to travel to different
parts of the body.

200
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,078
And I think you guys know what
we call these cells.

201
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:49,088
These cells that aren't
respecting their cellular

202
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,030
neighborhood.

203
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,096
They're growing like crazy.

204
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:55,069
They don't experience that
contact inhibition.

205
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,094
They're invasive.

206
00:09:56,094 --> 00:10:00,058
They start crowding out
other cells and

207
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,003
hogging up the resources.

208
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,028
And they keep mutating really
fast because they have all of

209
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,004
these genetic abnormalities.

210
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,014
And eventually they might even
break away and start

211
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:09,094
infiltrating other parts
of the body.

212
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:12,098
These are cancers
or cancer cells.

213
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:15,062


214
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,010
And so you might have
an appreciation for

215
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
why this is so hard.

216
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,024
Cancer is such a hard disease
to quote, unquote, cure.

217
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,061
Because it really isn't
just one disease.

218
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:29,069
It's not like one type of
bacteria or one type of virus

219
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:32,044
that you can pinpoint and
say let's attack this.

220
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:36,079
Cancer is a whole class of
mutations where the cells

221
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,025
start exhibiting this fast
invasive growth and this

222
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,062
metastasis.

223
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:44,051
So you might look at one type of
cancer and be able to say,

224
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:48,070
hey, let's target the mutation
where the cells look like this

225
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,001
and you're able to knock
out some of them.

226
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,072
Let me do this in this color.

227
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:55,029
So maybe you're able to
knock out that guy,

228
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,015
that guy, that guy.

229
00:10:56,015 --> 00:11:00,002
But because their DNA
replication system might be

230
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,015
broken in some way, they
continue to mutate, so

231
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,078
eventually you have one version
that's able to not be

232
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,059
knocked out by whatever
method you get.

233
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,020
And so you have this kind of new
form of cancer, and then

234
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,017
that new form of cancer is
even harder to kill.

235
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,021
So you can imagine that
cancer is kind of a

236
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,049
never ending fight.

237
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:20,082
And you kind of have to attack
the general idea behind it.

238
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:23,076
Chemotherapy and radiation, all
of these type of things.

239
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:26,038
They try to attack things that
are fast growing because

240
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,091
that's the kind of
one common theme

241
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,002
behind all of the cancers.

242
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:33,080
And we could do a whole playlist
on what cancer is and

243
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,039
how people are attacking it, but
I wanted to at least show

244
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,086
you in this video that cancer
really is just a byproduct of

245
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:46,050
broken mitosis, or even more
specifically, broken DNA

246
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,053
replication.

247
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:53,010
That we have all of these cells
replicating themselves

248
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,045
every day on the order of 100
billion, and every now and

249
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,096
then something breaks.

250
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,064
Usually when they break, either
nothing happens or the

251
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,000
cell kills itself.

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,096
But every now and then, the
cells start replicating even

253
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:06,045
though they're broken.

254
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,048
And sometimes they start
replicating like crazy.

255
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,007
If they just replicate, but
they're really not doing any

256
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:11,072
harm, it's benign.

257
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,073
But if they start replicating
like crazy, taking over

258
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:15,095
resources and spreading through
the body, you're

259
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:17,040
dealing with a cancer.

260
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,098
So hopefully, you found
that interesting.

261
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:22,037
You already know a good bit of
the science that kind of deals

262
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:27,067
with what is probably one of
the worst ailments that we

263
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:30,047
deal with as creatures.

264
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,014
I mean, obviously, we're not
the only people who can

265
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:32,099
experience cancers.

266
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,034
Even plants have cancers.

267
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,060

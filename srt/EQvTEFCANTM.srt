1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,046


2
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:03,041
Let's review the Calvin
cycle a little bit.

3
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,041
Maybe I'm going to go into a
little bit more detail than

4
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,046
the last video.

5
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:10,010
And by doing that, we'll be
able to appreciate an

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,048
inefficiency, or what we think
is an inefficiency that occurs

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,064
in many photosynthetic plants.

8
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:18,035
So just to review the Calvin
cycle, you start

9
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,050
off with some CO2.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,094
In the last video, I had six
molecules of CO2 and six

11
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:27,014
molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate.

12
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:28,058
But in this one, just to show
you that I could have

13
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:32,042
literally just divided that last
cycle by two, I'm going

14
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,021
to start with three and three.

15
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,064
Three molecules of
carbon dioxide.

16
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:40,014
Three molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate.

17
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:43,002
If you don't remember what
ribulose bisphosphate was, it

18
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:48,040
was just a 5-carbon molecule.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,009
It had two phosphates on it.

20
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,079
I can draw the phosphates.

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,050
So you have a phosphate there.

22
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,007
And you have a phosphate
there.

23
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,067
And we saw on the last video--
and here I'm going to do a

24
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:01,042
little bit more detail.

25
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,074
Of course carbon dioxide,
there's only one carbon.

26
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:05,031
I can just draw a carbon
like that.

27
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,029
I mean, I don't want to draw
the oxygens right now.

28
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,051
I just want to focus on just
the carbons and maybe the

29
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:10,045
phosphates.

30
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,020
But in the last video we saw
that these two merged.

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,006
Or these two reacted.

32
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:21,095
They reacted in the presence
of ribulose bisphosphate

33
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:24,018
carbocylase, which
is this enzyme.

34
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:27,023
It was that big protein that I
showed you in the last video.

35
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:29,042
And it's called RuBisCo
for short.

36
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:32,039
So I'm going to write RuBisCo
in the middle

37
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,035
of this whole cycle.

38
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:37,068
Because all of this is going
on with the RuBisCo enzyme.

39
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:40,073
These molecules are joining on
to the RuBisCo enzyme and then

40
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:43,085
the ATP and the NADHs are
reacting on different parts.

41
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:46,081
And that's essentially what's
driving the whole reaction.

42
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,064
So you have all of this is
happening with that big

43
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:55,037
RuBisCo protein, or enzyme, or
whatever you want to call it.

44
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,037
And this just stands for
ribulose bisphosphate

45
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:58,073
carboxylate.

46
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:02,021
So it essentially telling you
that it merges a carbon onto

47
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,020
ribulose bisphosphate.

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,045
And the last video, I just did
a very hand-wavey, I didn't

49
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,046
show you all of the
intermediates.

50
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:11,087
But I showed you, look, if in
this situation you end up

51
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:15,056
using six ATPs and six NADHs,
you'll end up with

52
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:17,058
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

53
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:21,043
Or G3P.

54
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:24,003
Or that's also called
phosphoglyceraldehyde so you

55
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,033
can also write it as PGAL.

56
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,078
But a very easy way to visualize
it as just a

57
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:32,093
3-carbon chain with
a phosphate.

58
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,093
With a phosphate group.

59
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:40,062
And the last video when I
started with six carbon

60
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:43,059
dioxides and six ribulose
bisphosphates.

61
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:46,006
And I ended up with
12 of these.

62
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,077
Now I have three and three.

63
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:49,031
Now I'm going to end up
with six of these.

64
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,081
So I'm going to end
up with six G3Ps.

65
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,011
And the math works out, right?

66
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,071
I have three carbons plus three
times five carbons.

67
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,009
That's a total of 18 carbons.

68
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,025
And here I have six times
three carbons.

69
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,069
Or 18 carbons.

70
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,011
And that's what I showed you in
the last video, but there

71
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:08,012
are actually some intermediary
steps.

72
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,071
So the very first thing that's
actually formed is

73
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:12,096
3-phosphoglycerate.

74
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:20,062


75
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:23,018
And the whole reason why I'm
showing you this detail, and

76
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,037
maybe you're taking a biology
class where they actually go

77
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,040
into this level of details, is
I want to show that this

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,027
compound also gets produced in
that inefficient cycle that

79
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,096
we're going to explore
in this video.

80
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:36,021
So you get 3-phosphoglycerate,
which is

81
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,038
also a 3-carbon chain.

82
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:38,063
But it's a different
one than this.

83
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:41,053
And this isn't ready to produce
glucose just yet.

84
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:44,078
But you could also imagine that
as a 3-carbon chain with

85
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:46,036
a phosphate group.

86
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:50,025
And then, and course you're
going to produce six of these.

87
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,090
Just to make sure all the carbon
gets accounted for.

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,020
You have 18 carbons here, you
have 18 carbons here.

89
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,083
So you're going to
have six of these

90
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:00,058
3-phosphoglycerates get produced.

91
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:04,059
And then each of those gets
a phosphate from ATP.

92
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:07,099
So you're going to have
six ATPs come in.

93
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,046
Remember these ATPs got
produced in the light

94
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:14,046
dependent reactions that occur
in the membrane of our

95
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,012
thylakoids.

96
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:19,018
Anyway, we have these ATPs.

97
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:22,000
You have six ATPs.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,081
And then they become six ADPs.

99
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,077
So essentially they have given
away their phosphate groups.

100
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:29,004
So they're going to give one
phosphate group to each of

101
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:34,010
these six 3-phosphoglycerates.

102
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,087
And then you're going to end
up with this, right here.

103
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:37,092
I'm running out of space.

104
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:40,063
Maybe I didn't do it as neatly
as I should have.

105
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,024
But you're going to end up with
this three chain carbon,

106
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:45,057
or 3-carbon compound.

107
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:47,079
It's going to have two
phosphates then.

108
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,092
And this, you could
know the name.

109
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:51,017
This is 1 3-bisphosphoglycerate.

110
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,087


111
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,088
This was just
3-phosphoglycerate, which

112
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:58,022
means that the phosphate
is on the third carbon.

113
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:01,018
Now we have 1
3-bisphophoglycerate.

114
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:04,016
We have a phosphate on the
1-carbon and the 3-carbon.

115
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,001
We have two of them.

116
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,026
So it's bisphosphoglycerate.

117
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:09,007


118
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,005
So that's to get
us right there.

119
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,001
And then to get from the 1
3-biposphoglycerate, and of

120
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,011
course we have six
of these as well.

121
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,082
Six of these turn into
six of these.

122
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:22,043
And to turn these six 1
3-phosphoglycerate into our

123
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,068
three glyceraldehyde
3 phosphates, or

124
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:28,043
phosphoglyceraldehyde the
names are very daunting.

125
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:35,092
This is where we're actually
going to oxidize our NADPH.

126
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:39,002
Remember oxidizing is losing
electrons or losing hydrogens

127
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:41,027
with their electrons,
either way.

128
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:46,017
So here, on this step right
here, two things are going to

129
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,056
happen, actually.

130
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:57,075
You're going to have six NADPHs
become six NAD pluses.

131
00:05:57,075 --> 00:06:00,022
So they're losing that hydrogen
and the electrons.

132
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:03,044
And also one phosphate is going
to be lost from each of

133
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:04,093
these molecules.

134
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,029
And then you're going to
also have plus six of

135
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,013
the phosphate groups.

136
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,043
The phosphate groups don't
get lost here.

137
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:12,018
They get added onto these
molecules right there.

138
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:16,036
And then we end up with our
sixth glyceraldehyde

139
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:19,031
3-phosphates, which we learned
in the last video, we can then

140
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:22,072
use to produce fuel or
glucose or other

141
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:24,037
carbohydrates in the cell.

142
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:27,074
But we also learned that this
is called the Calvin cycle.

143
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:32,037
So all of it doesn't get used
to produce actual glucose or

144
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,085
other carbohydrates.

145
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:43,031
Most of it, out of the six, five
of them are going to be

146
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:47,018
used to produce our three
ribulose bisphosphates.

147
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:49,087
So let me do it like this.

148
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,043
So you're going to have five
G3Ps go in that direction.

149
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:59,002
So for every six G3Ps you
produce, five go back into the

150
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,067
cycle and then one
exits the cycle.

151
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,057
We saw this in the last video.

152
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:04,082
In the last video I had 12
here, so 10 went in this

153
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:06,042
direction and two in
this direction.

154
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,024
I'm just dividing everything
by two in this video.

155
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,097
And the whole reason why I
multiplied by two in the last

156
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,036
video is so that we end up
with two going into this

157
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,017
direction because two
is enough to produce

158
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,031
at least one glucose.

159
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,026
But we don't have to have two.

160
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:20,025
We could just say we do this
whole cycle twice to get two.

161
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:24,075
But anyway, I have one
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

162
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,025
coming out of this end.

163
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,055
And then these five
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates

164
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:31,041
that stay in the cycle.

165
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,094
Remember those are
just 3-carbons

166
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,088
with a phosphate group.

167
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:36,056
I drew it over here already.

168
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:42,043
They will then use another
three ATP.

169
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:51,060


170
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,062
So we end up with three ADPs.

171
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,049
And the phosphate groups
actually end up on the

172
00:07:56,049 --> 00:08:00,012
ribulose bisphosphate and they
get essentially recycled into

173
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,060
ribulose bisphosphate for the
whole cycle to happen again.

174
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,082
Remember when all this is
happening you can kind of

175
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:09,014
imagine in or on the surface
of this big enzyme.

176
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:10,039
This ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase.

177
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,098


178
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:16,093
And actually, just so you know
a piece of terminology, this

179
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:20,001
type of photosynthesis is called
C3 photosynthesis.

180
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:26,064


181
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:30,025
And the whole reason why it's
called C3 photosynthesis is

182
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:35,040
because the very first product
that you get when you react

183
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,084
with carbon dioxide, when the
first time you fix your carbon

184
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,085
dioxide-- remember carbon
dioxide fixation is when you

185
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,045
take it in its gaseous
form and you actually

186
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:45,060
put it into a molecule.

187
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,047
The very first carbon molecule
you get once the carbon

188
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:51,033
dioxide gets fixed is
a 3-carbon molecule.

189
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,001
It's phosphoglycerate.

190
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,016
That's why I showed
it to you there.

191
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:57,080
Because that's where
the three in the C3

192
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,091
photosynthesis comes from.

193
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:03,084
Now, everything I've just done
is a review of what we did in

194
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,074
the last video.

195
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:06,025
Maybe with a little
bit more detail.

196
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,047
And I showed you that you
don't have to start

197
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,025
with six and six.

198
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,096
You could start with three and
three and just have five go

199
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:13,062
down here and one go down
here instead of doubling

200
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,006
everything.

201
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:17,023
But what I want to show you now
is an inefficiency that

202
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,055
goes on in plants.

203
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:22,077
This RuBisCo doesn't
necessarily

204
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:25,063
just fix carbon dioxide.

205
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:29,029
It can also react with oxygen.

206
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,013
And actually, its name is
ribulose bisphosphate

207
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:36,057
carboxylase oxygenase, which
means it can react

208
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:39,002
with carbon or oxygen.

209
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:41,082
And this mechanism-- so let's
say you have your ribulose

210
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,074
bisphosphate hanging around.

211
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:50,037
You know we're in the stroma
of our chloroplast.

212
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:53,061
So let's say we have our five
ribulose bisphosphates.

213
00:09:53,061 --> 00:10:03,007


214
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:07,080
And instead of reacting with
carbon it can actually react

215
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,035
with oxygen.

216
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,082
So instead of having carbon
dioxide here, I can have O2

217
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:14,017
coming in here.

218
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:15,094
We have oxygen coming in here.

219
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:19,055
And all of this, once again, is
occurring on the surface or

220
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:23,050
with the assistance
of the RuBisCo.

221
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,028
The exact same, the
RuBisCo enzyme.

222
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:28,053
Ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase.

223
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:31,071


224
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:32,021
That's why.

225
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:34,052
Because it can also
fix oxygen.

226
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:38,079
And when these two things react,
you don't get useful

227
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,080
things that can be used for
fuel and all of that.

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,092
You end up with-- and my drawing
is a little messy--

229
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:52,024
you end up with-- well when
these two guys react-- you'll

230
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:59,033
end up with five molecules
of this guy right here.

231
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:03,097
Five molecules of this

232
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:07,030
3-phosphoglycerate right there.

233
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,079
Remember here we ended
up with six of them.

234
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,037
But now we're only going
to end up with five

235
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,062
phosphoglycerates.

236
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:17,076


237
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,007
I know the names are
all very confusing.

238
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,054
But the basic idea is to
remember that what's happening

239
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:25,095
here is if carbon dioxide isn't
getting fixed, oxygen

240
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,062
can get fixed.

241
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:28,087
And you end up with five
phosphoglycerates.

242
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,037
And you actually also end up
with five-- this is called

243
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:34,062
phosphoglycolate.

244
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:37,039
I know these are very
daunting names.

245
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:44,029
Phosphoglycolate, which is
a 2-carbon molecule.

246
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,037
Which makes sense because we
only have five carbons to

247
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,035
start with.

248
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:51,064
This thing right here is
a 3-carbon molecule.

249
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:55,008
That's a 3-carbon molecule
and this right here

250
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:56,075
is a 2-carbon molecule.

251
00:11:56,075 --> 00:12:00,000
So this right here is going to
be a 2-carbon molecule and it

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,087
has a phosphate group.

253
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,075
So as you can imagine, in this
situation we're not going to

254
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:07,071
be able to keep going forward
and produce our glyceraldehyde

255
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:11,010
3-phosphate, which we can then
use to make up carbohydrates.

256
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,095
We're stuck.

257
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,092
We just have these five
phosphoglycerates.

258
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:16,096


259
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:20,041
These can go on and some
percentage of them, but the

260
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,075
ratios are all getting
messed up.

261
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,069
But everything doesn't
necessarily happen this

262
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,075
cleanly in the cell.

263
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:28,060
These things can go on, but we
have one less being produced.

264
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,085
And this thing right here, it's
actually using up some of

265
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:35,075
our carbon from our ribulose
bisphosphate.

266
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,078
And if this thing kept going
up, all of our ribulose

267
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,090
bisphosphate is going
to get eaten up.

268
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,039
We're not going to be able to
continue on into this cycle

269
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,045
over and over again.

270
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:47,079
And actually this is kind
of a waste product.

271
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,070
Right here this is
a waste product.

272
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,040
Or we think it's a
waste product.

273
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,076
And this actually has to exit
your chloroplast and actually

274
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,076
get processed by other
organelles in the plant cells.

275
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:04,005
And these are called, these
waste processing organelles in

276
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:08,035
your cells, these are
peroxisomes I know there's a

277
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:11,005
lot of complicated
terminology here.

278
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:15,069
But the important thing to
remember, when RuBisCo fixes

279
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:19,020
oxygen, this is actually called
photorespiration.

280
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,022
That's an important
word to know.

281
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:22,047
Photorespiration.

282
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,086


283
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:28,066
All of a sudden, instead of
being able to carry forward

284
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:32,003
with your Calvin cycle and
produce a lot of sugar,

285
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,029
instead you are depleting
your RuBisCo.

286
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,005
So this is a very bad process.

287
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,000
This is going to get in the
way of your Calvin cycle.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,022
And remember how important
each of these G3Ps are.

289
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,050
Because for every turn of the
Calvin cycle, or at least the

290
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,063
way I did it, we only produce
one G3P that actually gets

291
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:51,022
used for something useful.

292
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:58,052
The other five G3Ps have to go
back to produce ribulose

293
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:00,048
bisphosphate.

294
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,032
RuBisCo of course
is the enzyme.

295
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:05,061
So in this situation we only
have five phosphoglycerates to

296
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,023
begin with.

297
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:10,064
Maybe if we have our ATP or an
NADH, we can convert these

298
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:13,076
five-- and it doesn't have to
go in this direction-- but

299
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:17,087
maybe we can convert these five
phosphoglycerates into

300
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,061
five glyceraldehyde
3-phosphates.

301
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,092
G3Ps.

302
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:26,029
Then all of these are going to
be used back to produce our

303
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,015
ribulose bisphosphate.

304
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:30,069
So to go from here to here,
we actually had to

305
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,015
use up ATP and NADH.

306
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:36,009
And then to go from here to
here, we have to use more ATP.

307
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,035
But we went through this whole
cycle and we didn't produce

308
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:41,082
anything, in terms of useful
things that can be used to--

309
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:44,004
essentially sugars or
carbohydrates that can be used

310
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:47,094
to fuel or provide structure
for the plant in any way.

311
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,049
So this is a completely--
or we think-- this

312
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:51,076
is a wasteful process.

313
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:55,099


314
00:14:55,099 --> 00:15:00,003
So people wonder, when you
look a lot of biological

315
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:02,055
systems you don't see wasteful
processes all the time.

316
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:05,024
You would say, well wouldn't
natural selection have

317
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:06,048
selected against this?

318
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:09,049
And some people believe that
this is just a remnant from

319
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:13,050
our evolutionary past, or our
plants' evolutionary past,

320
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,086
where there wasn't a lot of
oxygen in the atmosphere.

321
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:21,003
And if there wasn't a lot of
oxygen in the atmosphere, this

322
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,002
was not that likely
of an occurrence.

323
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:25,062
But there's some people who
actually believe that no, this

324
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,076
might actually have
been selected

325
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,010
for in natural selection.

326
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,083
Because if there is a lot of
oxygen hanging around in the

327
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:37,071
cell, more than you need, that
oxygen might actually react

328
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:41,019
with your ATP and create other
harmful compounds in the cell.

329
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:45,002
And this might be a way of
sopping up the harmful oxygen

330
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,011
that's actually hanging
around the cell.

331
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,004
So who knows?

332
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:49,038
But it's interesting idea.

333
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:53,023
That you have this one enzyme
that can react with ribulose

334
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:56,021
bisphosphate and
carbon dioxide.

335
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,032
And if that happens, we just get
our regular Calvin cycle.

336
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:04,025
Or it can react with ribulose
bisphosphate and oxygen and

337
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:07,030
actually fix oxygen into
these two molecules.

338
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,061
Especially the phosphoglycolate
which we

339
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:11,012
think is a waste compound.

340
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,032
And if you just went on and on
in the Calvin cycle in this

341
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:19,046
way, you will not produce
any useful sugars.

342
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,096
So in the next video, what I
want to do is study some

343
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:25,030
plants that have been
able to get by this

344
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,085
photorespiration problem.

345
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,085
And you could imagine,
photorespiration could be a

346
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:33,020
really big deal or it could be
very harmful in situations

347
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,003
where, one, it's very important
for a plant to be

348
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,073
very productive of sugars.

349
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:41,088
And it can also, we'll see,
it can be a problem-- it's

350
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:43,054
definitely a problem if there's
a huge amount of

351
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:44,044
oxygen content.

352
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,088
But in the next video I'm going
to show you plants that

353
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,060
have gotten around this
problem by, instead of

354
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,002
performing C-3 photosynthesis,
which is the classic Calvin

355
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:58,032
cycle that I just showed
you, they perform C-4

356
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,012
photosynthesis.

357
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:01,084
And I'll show you what that
means in the next video.

358
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,055

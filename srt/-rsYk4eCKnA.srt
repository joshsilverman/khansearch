1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,099
Let's talk about
one of the most

2
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:04,055
important biological processes.

3
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:07,021
Frankly, if this process didn't
occur, we probably

4
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:09,047
wouldn't have life on Earth, and
I wouldn't be making this

5
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:11,090
video for you, because there'd
be no place for me to

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,035
actually get food.

7
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,086
And the process is called
photosynthesis.

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,041
And you're probably reasonably
familiar with the idea.

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:28,008
The whole idea is plants, and
actually bacteria and algae

10
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:29,082
and other things,
but we normally

11
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:31,042
associate it with plants.

12
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,060
Let me make it in very simple
terms. So we normally

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,018
associate it with plants.

14
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:38,052
And it's a process that plants
use, and we might have learned

15
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:39,072
this when we were very young.

16
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,056
It's the process that plants
use to take carbon dioxide

17
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:56,049
plus some water plus some
sunlight and turn it into some

18
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:00,000
sugars or some maybe
carbohydrates.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,015
Carbohydrates or sugars
plus oxygen.

20
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:09,035
Obviously, this has two very
profound pieces to it for us

21
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,079
as a living species.

22
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,020
One, we need carbohydrates or
we need sugars in order to

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,023
fuel our bodies.

24
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,068
You saw that in the cellular
respiration videos.

25
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:21,054
We generate all of our ATP
by performing cellular

26
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:24,098
respiration on glucose, which is
essentially a byproduct, or

27
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:27,001
a broken down carbohydrate.

28
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,053
It's the simplest one for us
to process in cellular

29
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:31,025
respiration.

30
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,023
And the second hugely
important part

31
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,032
is getting the oxygen.

32
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:38,048
Once again, we need to breathe
oxygen in order for us to

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,050
break down glucose, in order
to respire, in order to

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,009
perform cellar respiration.

35
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,073
So these two things are key for
life, especially for life

36
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:51,098
that breathes oxygen.

37
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,021
So this process, other than
the fact that it's

38
00:01:56,021 --> 00:02:01,020
interesting, that there are
organisms around us, mostly

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,012
plants, that are able to harness
actual sunlight.

40
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:07,090
You have these fusion reactions
in the sun 93

41
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,011
million miles away, and it's
releasing these photons, and

42
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,056
some small subset of
those photons reach

43
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:14,078
the surface of Earth.

44
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:17,068
They make their way through
clouds and whatever else.

45
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,056
And then these plants and
bacteria and algae are able to

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,000
harness that somehow and turn
them into sugars that we can

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,012
then eat or maybe the cow eats
them and we eat the cow if

48
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:33,028
we're not vegetarians, and we
can then use that for energy.

49
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,096
Not that the cow is all
carbohydrates, but this is

50
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:39,019
essentially what is used as the
fuel or the energy for all

51
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,036
of the other important compounds
that we eat.

52
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,093
This is where we get
all of our fuel.

53
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:45,044
So this is fuel for animals.

54
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:50,062
Or you know, if you eat a
potato directly, you are

55
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,037
directly getting your
carbohydrates.

56
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:55,015
But anyway, this is a very
simple notion of

57
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,075
photosynthesis, but it's
not incorrect.

58
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,055
I mean, if you had to know one
thing about photosynthesis,

59
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:00,028
this would be it.

60
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,063
But let's delve a little bit
deeper and try to get into the

61
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:05,093
guts of it and see if we can
understand a little bit better

62
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,096
how this actually happens.

63
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:10,078
I find it amazing that somehow
photons of sunlight are used

64
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:13,053
to create these sugar
molecules or these

65
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:14,022
carbohydrates.

66
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,084
So let's delve a little
bit deeper.

67
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:21,034
So we can write the general
equation for photosynthesis.

68
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,053
Well, I've almost
written it here.

69
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:27,071
But I'll write it a little bit
more scientifically specific.

70
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:30,063
You start off with some
carbon dioxide.

71
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:34,088
You add to that some water, and
you add to that-- instead

72
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,003
of sunlight, I'm going to say
photons because these are what

73
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:42,006
really do excite the electrons
in the chlorophyll that go

74
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:44,096
down, and you'll see this
process probably in this

75
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:47,053
video, and we'll go in more
detail in the next few videos.

76
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:50,009
But that excited electron goes
to a high energy state, and as

77
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:52,028
it goes to a lower energy state,
we're able to harness

78
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:57,018
that energy to produce ATPs,
and you'll see NADPHs, and

79
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,018
those are used to produce
carbohydrates.

80
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:01,008
But we'll see that
in a little bit.

81
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,059
But the overview of
photosynthesis, you start off

82
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:10,030
with these constituents, And
then you end up with a

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,021
carbohydrate.

84
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,061
And a carbohydrate
could be glucose,

85
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,008
doesn't have to be glucose.

86
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:18,011
So the general way we can write
a carbohydrates is CH2O.

87
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:24,020
And we'll put an n over here,
that we could have n multiples

88
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,013
of these, and normally, n
will be at least three.

89
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,099
In the case of glucose,
n is 6.

90
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:34,042
You have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens
and 6 oxygens.

91
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,061
So this is a general term for
carbohydrates, but you could

92
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:38,010
have many multiples of that.

93
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,081
You could have these
long-chained carbohydrates, so

94
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,062
you end up with a carbohydrate
and then you end

95
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:45,092
up with some oxygen.

96
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:48,073
So this right here isn't so
different than what I wrote up

97
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:52,010
here in my first overview of
how we always imagined

98
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,072
photosynthesis in our heads.

99
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:56,018
In order to make this equation
balance-- let's see, I have n

100
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:59,077
carbons so I need
n carbons there.

101
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:02,086
Let's see, I have two
n hydrogens here.

102
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:05,047
Two hydrogens and I have n
there, so I need two n

103
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:06,001
hydrogens here.

104
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,014
So I'll put an n out there.

105
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,039
And lets see how many oxygens.

106
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,063
I have two n oxygens,
plus another n, so I

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
have three n oxygens.

108
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,045
So let's see, I have one n,
and you put an n here, and

109
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:21,088
then I have two n, and I think
this equation balances out.

110
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:26,085
So this is a 30,000-foot view
of what's going on in

111
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,075
photosynthesis.

112
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:29,073
But when you dig a little
deeper, you'll see that this

113
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:32,089
doesn't happen directly, that
this happens through a bunch

114
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:37,026
of steps that eventually gets
us to the carbohydrate.

115
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:40,085
So in general, we can break
down photosynthesis.

116
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,043
I'll rewrite the word.

117
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:47,082
We can break down
photosynthesis-- and we'll

118
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,095
delve deeper into future videos,
but I want to get you

119
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:54,022
the overview first--
into two stages.

120
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,007
We can call one the
light reactions.

121
00:05:58,086 --> 00:06:01,089
Or sometimes they are called the
light-dependent reactions,

122
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:04,000
and that actually would
probably be a better

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,082
way to write it.

124
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,083
Let me write it like that.

125
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:10,087
Light dependent means that
they need light to occur.

126
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,030
Light-dependent reactions.

127
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,050
And then you have something
called the dark reactions, and

128
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,013
that's actually a bad name,
because it also

129
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,085
occurs in the light.

130
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:23,030
Dark reactions, I wrote in
a slightly darker color.

131
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,042
And the reason why I said it's a
bad name is because it still

132
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,080
occurs in the light.

133
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,094
But the reason why they probably
called it the dark

134
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:38,010
reaction is that you don't need
light, or that part of

135
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,062
photosynthesis isn't dependent
on photons to occur.

136
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:45,012
So a better term for
it would have been

137
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:55,069
light-independent reaction.

138
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:58,018
So just to be clear,
the light reactions

139
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,091
actually need sunlight.

140
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,042
They actually need photons
for them to proceed.

141
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:07,050
The dark reactions do not need
photons for them to happen,

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,024
although they do occur
when the sun is out.

143
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:13,000
They don't need those photons,
but they need the byproducts

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,080
from the light reaction to
occur, so that's why it's

145
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,023
called the light-independent
reaction.

146
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:19,030
They occur while the sun
is out, but they

147
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,057
don't need the sun.

148
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:24,026
This needs the sun, so let
me make it very clear.

149
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,097
So this requires sunlight.

150
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:28,035
This requires photons.

151
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:35,027
And let me just make a very
brief overview of this.

152
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:38,087
This'll maybe let us start
building a scaffold from which

153
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,039
we can dig deeper.

154
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,087
So the light reactions
need photons, and

155
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,000
then it needs water.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,060
So water goes into the light
reactions and out of the other

157
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,081
side of the light reactions.

158
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:52,085
We end up with some
molecular oxygen.

159
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,087
So that's what happens in the
light reactions, and I'm going

160
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,037
to go much deeper into
what actually occurs.

161
00:07:57,037 --> 00:08:03,002
And what the light the actions
produce is ATP, which we know

162
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:07,070
is the cellular or the
biological currency of energy.

163
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,075
It produces ATP and
it produces NADPH.

164
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,079
Now, when we studied cellular
respiration, we saw the

165
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,093
molecule NADH.

166
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:21,031
NADPH is very similar.

167
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:23,025
You just have this P there.

168
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,070
You just have this phosphate
group there, but they really

169
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,058
perform similar mechanisms. That
this agent right here,

170
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:37,065
this molecule right here, is
able to give away-- now let's

171
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:41,003
think about what this means--
it's able to give away this

172
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,096
hydrogen and the electron
associated with this hydrogen.

173
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:48,087
So if you give away an electron
to someone else or

174
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:51,069
someone else gains an electron,
that something else

175
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,030
is being reduced.

176
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,050
Let me write that down.

177
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,035
This is a good reminder.

178
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,082
OIL RIG.

179
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:02,075
Oxidation is losing
an electron.

180
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,075
Reduction is gaining
an electron.

181
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:07,042
Your charge is reduced when
you gain an electron.

182
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,095
It has a negative charge.

183
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,076
So this is a reducing agent.

184
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:14,080
It gets oxidized by losing
the hydrogen and the

185
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,062
electron with it.

186
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:18,005
I have a whole discussion
on the biological versus

187
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,066
chemistry view of oxidation,
but it's the same idea.

188
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:25,052
When I lose a hydrogen, I also
lose the ability to hog that

189
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:27,012
hydrogen's electron.

190
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:30,026
So this right here, when it
reacts with other things, it's

191
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:31,090
a reducing agent.

192
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:37,002
It gives away this hydrogen and
the electron associated

193
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:40,054
with it, and so the other
thing gets reduced.

194
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,065
So this thing is a
reducing agent.

195
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:49,088
And what's useful about it is
when this hydrogen, and

196
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,023
especially the electron
associated with that hydrogen,

197
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:56,095
goes from the NADPH to, say,
another molecule and goes to a

198
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:01,075
lower energy state, that energy
can also be used in the

199
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:02,057
dark reactions.

200
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:04,079
And we saw in cellular
respiration the very similar

201
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,057
molecule, NADH, that through
the Kreb Cycle, or actually

202
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:11,095
more importantly, that through
the electron transport chain,

203
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:17,035
was able to help produce ATP as
it gave away its electrons

204
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:18,076
and they went to lower
energy states.

205
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,040
But I don't want to confuse
you too much.

206
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,027
So the light reactions, you take
in photons, you take in

207
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:28,092
water, it spits out oxygen, and
it spits out ATP and NADPH

208
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:32,002
that can then be used in
the dark reactions.

209
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,051
And the dark reactions, for
most plants we talk about,

210
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,076
it's called the Calvin Cycle.

211
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:43,037
And I'll go into a lot more
detail of what actually occurs

212
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:48,080
in the Calvin Cycle, but it
takes in the ATP, the NADPH,

213
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:56,048
and it produces-- it doesn't
directly produce glucose.

214
00:10:56,048 --> 00:11:00,040
It produces-- oh, you
probably saw this.

215
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,033
You could call it PGAL.

216
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,099
You could call it G3P.

217
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:09,040
These all stand for-- let me
write these down-- this is

218
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,065
phosphoglyceraldehyde.

219
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,040
My handwriting broke down.

220
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,090
Or you could call it
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

221
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,021
Same exact molecule.

222
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:41,032
You can almost imagine it as--
this is a very gross

223
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:45,000
oversimplification-- as three
carbons with a phosphate group

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,025
attached to it.

225
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:51,075
But this can then be used to
produce other carbohydrates,

226
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,062
including glucose.

227
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,097
If you have two of these,
you can use those

228
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:57,015
two to produce glucose.

229
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:59,082
So let's just take a quick
overview again because this is

230
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:00,061
super important.

231
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm going to make videos on the
light reactions and the

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,002
dark reactions.

233
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,085
Those will be the next
two videos I make.

234
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,045
So photosynthesis, you
start with photons.

235
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:11,050
All of these occur when the sun
is out, but only the light

236
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,026
reactions actually
need the photons.

237
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,009
The light reactions take
photons-- we're going to go

238
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,074
into more detail about what
actually occurs--

239
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:19,054
and it takes in water.

240
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:21,012
Oxygen gets spit out.

241
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:24,066
ATP and NADPH get spit out,
which are then used by the

242
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:28,001
dark reaction, or the
Calvin Cycle, or the

243
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,030
light-independent reaction,
because these still

244
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,047
occur in the light.

245
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:32,082
They just don't need photons.

246
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,098
So they're the light-independent
reaction.

247
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:37,052
And it uses that in
conjunction-- and we'll talk

248
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,094
about other molecules that
are used in conjunction.

249
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:43,095
Oh, and I forgot a very
important constituent of the

250
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,084
dark reaction.

251
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,069
It needs carbon dioxide.

252
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,007
That's where you get your
carbons to keep producing

253
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:54,022
these phosphoglyceraldehydes, or
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

254
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,060
So that's super important.

255
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,083
It takes in the carbon dioxide,
the products from the

256
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:05,000
light reactions, and then uses
that in the Calvin Cycle to

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,007
produce this very simple
building block of other

258
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:09,098
carbohydrates.

259
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:12,078
And if you remember from
glycolysis, you might remember

260
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,064
that this PGAL molecule, or this
G3P-- same thing-- this

261
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:20,021
was actually the first product
when we split glucose in two

262
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:21,072
when we performed
the glycolysis.

263
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,026
So now we're going
the other way.

264
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:25,053
We're building glucose
so that we can split

265
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,090
it later for energy.

266
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,034
So this is an overview of
photosynthesis, and in the

267
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,009
next couple of videos, I'm
actually going to delve a

268
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,042
little bit deeper and tell you
about the light reactions and

269
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:36,062
the dark reactions and how
they actually occur.

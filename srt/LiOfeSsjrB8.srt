1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040


2
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,023
In the last video, we learned
how myosin-- and myosin II in

3
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:06,037
particular-- when we say myosin
II it actually has two

4
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:09,046
of these myosin heads and their
tails are inter-wound

5
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:13,003
with each other-- how myosin
II can use ATP to

6
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:16,055
essentially-- you can almost
imagine either pulling an

7
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:19,038
actin filament or walking
up an actin filament.

8
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:20,092
It starts attached.

9
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:23,007
ATP comes and bonds onto it.

10
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,037
That causes it to be released.

11
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:31,064
Then the ATP hydrolyzes into
ADP and a phosphate group.

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,079
And when that happens, that
energy's released.

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,061
It puts this into a higher
energy state.

14
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:39,090
It kind of spring-loads the
protein and then it attaches

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,007
up another notch on the actual
actin filament and then the

16
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:47,028
phosphate group leaves and
that's where the confirmation

17
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:49,075
change in this protein
is enough.

18
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,065
It generates the power stroke to
actually push on the actin

19
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:55,047
filament-- and you could
imagine, either move the

20
00:00:55,047 --> 00:01:00,024
myosin-- whatever the myosin is
connected to-- to the left

21
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,060
or whatever the actin is
connected to to the right.

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,001
We're going to talk a lot more
about what they're connected

23
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,045
to in future videos.

24
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:09,012
Now, a couple of questions
might have been

25
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:10,079
raising in your head.

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,062
This guy had so much effort to
pull on this thing, right?

27
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:16,087
There's some tension pulling in
the other direction, right?

28
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:19,087
I said this is what happens in
muscles, so there must be some

29
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,076
weight or some other
resistance.

30
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:25,020
So what happens when
this releases?

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,098
At the first step when ATP
joined and this released,

32
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:32,043
wouldn't the actin filament
just go back to

33
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,037
where it was before?

34
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:35,018
Especially if there's
some tension on it

35
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:37,051
going in that direction.

36
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:42,015
And the simple answer to that
is, this isn't the only myosin

37
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:45,014
protein that's acting
on this actin.

38
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:47,037
You have others all
along the chain.

39
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,073
Maybe you have one
right there.

40
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:50,064
Maybe you have one
right there.

41
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:53,015
They're all working at their own
pace at different times.

42
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,054
So you have so many of these
that when one of them is

43
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,084
disengaged, another one of them
might be in their power

44
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,098
stroke or another one
might be engaged.

45
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:02,075
So it's not like you have this
notion of, if all of a sudden

46
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:06,023
one lets go, that the actin
filament will recoil back to

47
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:07,020
where it was.

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,059
Now the next question that you
might be thinking is, how do I

49
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:13,099
turn on and off this
situation?

50
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,059
We have command over
our muscles.

51
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:20,049
What can turn on or off this
system of the myosin

52
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,068
essentially crawling
up the actin?

53
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:25,046
And to understand that, there's
two other proteins

54
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,090
that come into effect.

55
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,087
That's tropomyosin
and troponin.

56
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:48,027


57
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:51,075
And so I'm going to redraw the
actin-- I'll do a very rough

58
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,090
drawing of the actin filament.

59
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,018
Let's say that that's my actin
filament right there with its

60
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:56,078
little grooves.

61
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:58,003
It's actually a helical
structure.

62
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:05,062


63
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:08,008
And actually, these grooves--
it's kind of a helical-- but

64
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,000
we won't worry too
much about that.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,055
What we drew so far, at least
in the last video, you had

66
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,049
these little myosin.

67
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,086
You can view them as feet or
head or whatever that keep

68
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:21,049
attaching to it and then based
on where they are in that ATP

69
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,069
cycle, they can keep getting
cranked back up or

70
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,065
sprinr-loaded and go to the
next one and push back.

71
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:29,065
Now, on top of this actin,
you actually have

72
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:31,015
this tropomyosin protein.

73
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:38,003
And this tropomyosin protein,
it coils around the actin.

74
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:41,027
So this is our actin
right here.

75
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:44,075
This is one of the two heads
of the myosin II.

76
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:47,083


77
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,099
And then we have our
tropomyosin.

78
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,097
Tropomyosin is coiled around.

79
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:55,025
It's a very rough sketch, but
you can imagine it's coiled

80
00:03:55,025 --> 00:04:00,000
around and it goes back behind
it, then it goes like that,

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
and then it goes back behind
it, then it goes like that.

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,003
So it's coiled around it and the
important thing about it

83
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:10,021
is, if there's-- let me
take a step back.

84
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:13,086
It's coiled around and it's
attached to the actin by

85
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,025
another protein called
troponin.

86
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,095


87
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:20,086
Let's say it's attached there
and-- this isn't exact, but

88
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:25,026
let's say it's attached there,
and there, and there, and

89
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:27,061
there, and there by
the troponin.

90
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,086
So let me write this down.

91
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:40,019


92
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,054
So you can imagine, the troponin
is kind of like the

93
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:44,079
nails into the actin.

94
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,005
So it dictates where
the tropomyosin is.

95
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:54,004
So when a muscle is not
contracting, it turns out that

96
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:57,097
the tropomyosin is blocking
the myosin from being able

97
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,068
to-- and I've read a bunch of
accounts on this and I think

98
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,049
this is still an area
of research.

99
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:04,068
It's not 100% clear one
way or the other.

100
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:08,085
Tropomyosin is-- or maybe both--
blocking the myosin

101
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:11,087
from being able to attach to
the actin where it normally

102
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:15,062
attaches so it won't be able
to crawl up the actin-- or

103
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:18,008
sometimes the myosin is attached
to the actin, but it

104
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:21,083
keeps it from releasing and
sliding up the actin to keep

105
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,027
that walking procedure.

106
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:27,050
So the bottom line is that
this tropomyosin kind of

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:42,093
blocks the myosin head-- this
is the myosin head right

108
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:55,076
there-- from crawling up the
actin, either by physically

109
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:59,074
blocking its actual binding site
or if it's already bound,

110
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:02,048
keeping it from being able to
keep sliding up the actin.

111
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:05,031
Either way, it's blocking it
and the only way to make it

112
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,024
unblocked is for the troponins
to actually change their

113
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:10,056
confirmation, for them to
change their shape.

114
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:13,032
And the only way for them to
change their shape is if we

115
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:17,037
have a high calcium
ion concentration.

116
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:23,030
So if you have a bunch of
calcium ions, if you have a

117
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,035
high enough concentration, these
calcium ions are going

118
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:31,075
to bond to the troponin and
then that changes the

119
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:35,097
confirmation of the troponin
enough to move the

120
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:38,035
configuration of the
tropomyosin.

121
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:40,025
So let me write this down.

122
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,012
So normally, tropomyosin blocks,
but then when you have

123
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:52,006
a high calcium ion
concentration, they bind to

124
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:59,083
troponin and then the troponin,
they change their

125
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,085
confirmation so it moves the
tropomyosin out of the way.

126
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:14,050


127
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,068
So when it moves out of the way,
you have a high calcium

128
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:21,036
concentration, bonds troponin,
moves tropomyosin out of the

129
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:23,076
way, then all of a sudden what
we talked about in the last

130
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,086
video-- these guys can start
walking up the actin or

131
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:29,018
pushing the actin to the
right, however you

132
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,020
want to view it.

133
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:38,030
But then if the calcium
concentration goes low, then

134
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,062
the calciums get released
from the troponin.

135
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:42,037
You need to have enough to
always hang around here.

136
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:44,062
If the concentration becomes
really low here, these guys

137
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:52,020
will start to leave. So then the
troponin goes back to, I

138
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,045
guess, standard confirmation.

139
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:57,092


140
00:07:57,092 --> 00:08:05,052
That makes the tropomyosin
block the myosin again.

141
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:12,073


142
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:14,076
So it's actually-- I
mean, I can't say

143
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,077
anything here is simple.

144
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:19,081
This was only discovered maybe
50 or 60 years ago and you can

145
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,020
imagine to actually observe
these things or to create

146
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,083
experiments to definitively
know what's happening--

147
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:28,056
nothing is simple, but
the idea is simple.

148
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:32,049
Without calcium, the tropomyosin
is blocking the

149
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,054
ability of the myosin to attach
where it needs to

150
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:38,055
attach or slide up the actin so
it can keep pushing on it.

151
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,004
But if the calcium concentration
is high enough,

152
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,061
they will bond to the troponin--
which essentially

153
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:48,097
nails down the tropomyosin
that's wound around the actin

154
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,062
and when they change their
confirmation with the calcium

155
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:57,047
ions, it moves the tropomyosin
out of the way so that the

156
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,059
myosin can do what it does.

157
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:03,042
So you can imagine already,
we're building up a way for--

158
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,083
one, for muscles to contract,
but even better, for us to

159
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,057
control muscles to contract.

160
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:11,053
So if we have a high calcium
concentration within the cell,

161
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:13,004
the muscle will contract.

162
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:16,005
If we have a low calcium
concentration again, then all

163
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,070
of a sudden, these
will release.

164
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,099
They'll be blocked, and then the
muscle will relax again.

165
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:21,069

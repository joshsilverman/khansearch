1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,061


2
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:03,062
We could have a debate about
what the most interesting cell

3
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:07,054
in the human body is, but I
think easily the neuron would

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:10,081
make the top five, and it's
not just because the cell

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,083
itself is interesting.

6
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,064
The fact that it essentially
makes up our brain and our

7
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:17,042
nervous system and is
responsible for the thoughts

8
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:22,001
and our feelings and maybe for
all of our sentience, I think,

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,062
would easily make it the
top one or two cells.

10
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:26,092
So what I want to do is first
to show you what a neuron

11
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,044
looks like.

12
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:30,028
And, of course, this is kind
of the perfect example.

13
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,067
This isn't what all
neurons look like.

14
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,035
And then we're going to talk
a little bit about how it

15
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,000
performs its function, which is
essentially communication,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,075
essentially transmitting signals
across its length,

17
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:43,039
depending on the signals
it receives.

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,046
So if I were to draw
a neuron-- let me

19
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,071
pick a better color.

20
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:50,075


21
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:52,006
So let's say I have a neuron.

22
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:53,011
It looks something like this.

23
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,078
So in the middle you have your
soma and then from the soma--

24
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:00,085
let me draw the nucleus.

25
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:03,039
This is a nucleus, just like
any cell's nucleus.

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,018
And then the soma's considered
the body of the neuron and

27
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:09,026
then the neuron has these little
things sticking out

28
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:13,068
from it that keep
branching off.

29
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:16,007
Maybe they look something
like this.

30
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,090
I don't want to spend too much
time just drawing the neuron,

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,070
but you've probably seen
drawings like this before.

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,081
And these branches off of the
soma of the neuron, off of its

33
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:32,001
body, these are called
dendrites.

34
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:34,045
They can keep splitting
off like that.

35
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:36,098
I want to do a fairly reasonable
drawing so I'll

36
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:39,004
spend a little time
doing that.

37
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:43,000


38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,014
So these right here, these
are dendrites.

39
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:48,050
And these tend to be--
and nothing is

40
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,085
always the case in biology.

41
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:53,015
Sometimes different parts of
different cells perform other

42
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:56,093
functions, but these tend to be
where the neuron receives

43
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,015
its signal.

44
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:01,021
And we'll talk more about what
it means to receive and

45
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,037
transmit a signal in
this video and

46
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,093
probably in the next few.

47
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:09,062
So this is where it receives
the signal.

48
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,015
So this is the dendrite.

49
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,003
This right here is the soma.

50
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:14,038
Soma means body.

51
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,012
This is the body
of the neuron.

52
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,059
And then we have kind of a--
you can almost view it as a

53
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:22,009
tail of the neuron.

54
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,034
It's called the axon.

55
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:26,033


56
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:29,087
A neuron can be a reasonably
normal sized cell, although

57
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,081
there is a huge range, but the
axons can be quite long.

58
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,087
They could be short.

59
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:36,052
Sometimes in the brain you might
have very small axons,

60
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:39,061
but you might have axons that
go down the spinal column or

61
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,018
that go along one of your
limbs-- or if you're talking

62
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,024
about one of a dinosaur's
limbs.

63
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:47,018
So the axon can actually
stretch several feet.

64
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,015
Not all neurons' axons
are several feet,

65
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,015
but they could be.

66
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:53,075
And this is really where a lot
of the distance of the signal

67
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,009
gets traveled.

68
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,018
Let me draw the axon.

69
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:01,062
So the axon will look
something like this.

70
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:06,008
And at the end, it ends at the
axon terminal where it can

71
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:10,036
connect to other dendrites or
maybe to other types of tissue

72
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,099
or muscle if the point of this
neuron is to tell a muscle to

73
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,090
do something.

74
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,081
So at the end of the axon,
you have the axon

75
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:19,006
terminal right there.

76
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:22,016
I'll do my best to draw
it like that.

77
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:22,083
Let me label it.

78
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,027
So this is the axon.

79
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:26,053
This is the axon terminal.

80
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:29,078


81
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:33,009
And you'll sometimes hear the
word-- the point at which the

82
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:36,059
soma or the body of the neuron
connects to the axon is as

83
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:39,040
often referred to as the axon
hillock-- maybe you can kind

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,037
of view it as kind of a lump.

85
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,068
It starts to form the axon.

86
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:46,074


87
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:54,061
And then we're going to talk
about how the impulses travel.

88
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:58,096
And a huge part in what allows
them to travel efficiently are

89
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:01,041
these insulating cells
around the axon.

90
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,075


91
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:06,052
We're going to talk about this
in detail and how they

92
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:09,022
actually work, but it's good
just to have the anatomical

93
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:17,042
structure first. So these are
called Schwann cells and

94
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,044
they're covering-- they make
up the myelin sheath.

95
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:23,004
So this covering, this
insulation, at different

96
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,085
intervals around the
axon, this is

97
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:26,070
called the myelin sheath.

98
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,054
So Schwann cells make up
the myelin sheath.

99
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll do one more
just like that.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,004


101
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,077
And then these little spaces
between the myelin sheath--

102
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:46,038
just so we have all of the
terminology from-- so we know

103
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,064
the entire anatomy of the
neuron-- these are called the

104
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,089
nodes of Ranvier.

105
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:56,062


106
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,094
I guess they're named
after Ranvier.

107
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:59,091
Maybe he was the guy who looked
and saw they had these

108
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,081
little slots here where you
don't have myelin sheath.

109
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,027
So these are the nodes
of Ranvier.

110
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:07,098
So the general idea, as I
mentioned, is that you get a

111
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,086
signal here.

112
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:11,006
We're going to talk more about
what the signal means-- and

113
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,088
then that signal gets--
actually, the signals can be

114
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:16,057
summed, so you might have one
little signal right there,

115
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:19,044
another signal right there, and
then you'll have maybe a

116
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:23,000
larger signal there and there--
and that the combined

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,077
effects of these signals get
summed up and they travel to

118
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:30,043
the hillock and if they're a
large enough, they're going to

119
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:34,093
trigger an action potential on
the axon, which will cause a

120
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,027
signal to travel down the
balance of the axon and then

121
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:42,092
over here it might be connected
via synapses to

122
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,043
other dendrites or muscles.

123
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,042
And we'll talk more about
synapses and those might help

124
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,079
trigger other things.

125
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,076
So you're saying, what's
triggering these things here?

126
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:54,039
Well, this could be the terminal
end of other neurons'

127
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,010
axons, like in the brain.

128
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,091
This could be some type
of sensory neuron.

129
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,049
This could be on a taste bud
someplace, so a salt molecule

130
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:06,027
somehow can trigger it or a
sugar molecule-- or this might

131
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:07,038
be some type of sensor.

132
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,011
It could be a whole bunch of
different things and we'll

133
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:11,069
talk more about the different
types of neurons.

134
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,094

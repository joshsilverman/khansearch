1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,049


2
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,027
I've done a bunch of videos
already on respiration.

3
00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:06,044
I think even before those
videos, you had a sense that

4
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:13,050
we need oxygen and that
we release CO2.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,019
And if you watched the videos on
respiration, you know that

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:21,048
we need the oxygen in order to
metabolize our food, in order

7
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:25,098
to turn our food into ATPs
that can then drive other

8
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:28,030
types of cellular functions--
or anything that we have to

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,003
do; move, or breathe, or think,
or everything that we

10
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:31,048
have to do.

11
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:35,082
And that through the process of
respiration, we break down

12
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:39,021
those sugars and we release
carbon dioxide.

13
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:42,097
So in this video, what I want to
do is take a big step back

14
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:45,077
and think about how we actually
get our oxygen into

15
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:49,047
our body and how we release it
back out into the atmosphere.

16
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,061
Another way to think about it is
how we ventilate ourselves.

17
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:54,025


18
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,002
How do we get the oxygen in, and
how do we get the carbon

19
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:58,020
dioxide out?

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,056
And I think any of us could at
least start off this video.

21
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:04,003
It starts off in either
our nose or our mouth.

22
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,082
I always have a clogged sinus
so I often have to

23
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:08,071
deal with my mouth.

24
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,010
I sleep with my mouth often.

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,034
But it always starts in our
nose or our mouths.

26
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:15,084
Let me draw someone with
a nose and a mouth.

27
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,084
So let's say that this
is my person.

28
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:21,086
Maybe his mouth will be open
so that he can breathe.

29
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:25,034


30
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:28,037
His eyes aren't important,
but just so

31
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:29,079
you know it's a person.

32
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,060
So this is my test subject
or the person I'm

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,090
going to use to diagram.

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,034
That's his ear.

35
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:41,048
Maybe he has a bit of a-- let's
give him some hair.

36
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:45,020


37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,079
All of that is irrelevant,
but this is our guy.

38
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,020
This is the guy that's going to
show us how we take air in

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,012
and how we take air
out of the body.

40
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:57,090
So let's go inside
of this guy.

41
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,068
I can draw his outside
first. Let me see how

42
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:02,051
well I can do this.

43
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,039
So this is outside the guy.

44
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,043
That doesn't look right.

45
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,041
Let's say the guy looks
something like this and he's

46
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,090
got-- this is his shoulders.

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,000
That's our guy.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,090
All right.

49
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,019
So in our mouth, we have our
oral cavity right there, which

50
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,065
is just the space that
our mouth creates.

51
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,077
We have our oral cavity.

52
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:25,096
I could draw our tongue and all
of that and maybe I will.

53
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,005
Maybe I'll draw the tongue.

54
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:32,002


55
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,078
But you have this space inside
of the mouth-- call that the

56
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:36,003
oral cavity.

57
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:46,090


58
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,034
Oral for mouth, cavity for
space, or hole, or opening.

59
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,069
And then also you have your
nostrils and they open up into

60
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,094
a nasal cavity.

61
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:56,056


62
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,031
So that's another big space
just like this.

63
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:03,080
And we know that they connect at
the back of our nose or the

64
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,002
back of our mouth.

65
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:10,087
And this passage right here
where they connect is called

66
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,012
the pharynx.

67
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:17,018


68
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:19,063
When your air goes through your
nose-- they say breathing

69
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,068
through your nose is better,
probably because it gets

70
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,081
filtered by your nose hairs and
it gets warmed up and and

71
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:27,018
what not, but you can breathe
through either side.

72
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:32,090
The air goes in through either
your nasal cavity or your oral

73
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,041
cavity and then comes back
through your pharynx and then

74
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,021
the pharynx splits
into two pipes.

75
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,013
One for-- well, one, air can
go down either one, but the

76
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,065
other one is for food.

77
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,069
So your pharynx gets split.

78
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,071
In the back you have your
esophagus-- and we'll talk

79
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,028
more about the esophagus
in a future video.

80
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:57,053
In the back you have your
esophagus and in the front--

81
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,003
let me draw a little dividing
line there.

82
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:03,037
In the front, maybe this-- let
me make it connect like that.

83
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,031
I was using yellow.

84
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,087
I'm going to use yellow to
continue and I'm going to use

85
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,072
green for the air.

86
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,052
So it divides just like that.

87
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:12,034


88
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:16,055
So behind your air pipe, you
have your esophagus.

89
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:21,047


90
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,072
Let me make that
another color.

91
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:31,027


92
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:33,002
And then right here
is your larynx.

93
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:37,098


94
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,045
And I'm going to concern
ourselves with the larynx.

95
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:42,043
Esophagus is where your
food goes down.

96
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:44,091
We know that we eat food
with our mouth as well.

97
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,070
So this is where we
want our food to

98
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,031
go-- down the esophagus.

99
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:52,069
But the focus of this video
is our ventilation.

100
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,060
What do we do with our air?

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,025
So I'm going to focus as the air
goes through our larynx.

102
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:02,002
And the larynx is also
our voicebox.

103
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,045
So as you hear me talking right
now, there are these

104
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:08,036
little things right about here
that are vibrating at just the

105
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,089
right frequencies and I'm able
to shape the sound with my

106
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,032
mouth to make this video.

107
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:14,033
So that's also your voicebox,
but I won't focus

108
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,018
on that right now.

109
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:17,076
It's called a voicebox because
of this whole anatomical

110
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,057
structure that looks something
like that.

111
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:22,061
But then after the air passes
through the larynx-- this is

112
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:31,057
on the way in-- it goes to the
trachea, which is essentially

113
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:32,082
just the pipe for air.

114
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,017
The esophagus is the
pipe for food.

115
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,042
Let me write this down.

116
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,095


117
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:43,027
And then from the trachea-- and
the trachea is actually a

118
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,058
reasonably rigid structure.

119
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:46,077
It has cartilage around
it and it makes

120
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:47,097
sense that it has cartilage.

121
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,029
You don't want-- you can imagine
a hose-- if it bent a

122
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,024
lot, you wouldn't be able to get
a lot of water through it,

123
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:54,031
or a lot of air through it.

124
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,052
So you don't want this
thing to bend a lot.

125
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,062
So that's why it needs to have
some rigidity-- so that's why

126
00:05:58,062 --> 00:05:59,093
it has cartilage around it.

127
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:06,008
And then it splits into two
tubes-- and I think you know

128
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,026
where these two tubes
are going to.

129
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:10,058
And I'm not drawing this
in super detail.

130
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:13,041
I just want you to get the idea
of them, but these two

131
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,076
tubes are the bronchi-- or
each one is a bronchus.

132
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:21,085


133
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:24,055
And they also have cartilage,
so they're fairly rigid, but

134
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,048
the bronchi keep splitting.

135
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:31,013
They keep splitting into smaller
and smaller tubes just

136
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:33,031
like that and at some point,
they stop having cartilage.

137
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:35,068
They stop being reasonably
rigid, but they

138
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:37,029
keep splitting off.

139
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,002
So I'll just draw them as
these little lines.

140
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:42,052
At some point they become
such thin things.

141
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:44,017
They just keep splitting off.

142
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,056
So the air just keeps splitting
off and spread and

143
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:49,010
goes down the different paths.

144
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,039
And when the bronchi no longer
have cartilage around them,

145
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,049
they're no longer rigid.

146
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,068
The first of those are called--
or actually all the

147
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:59,048
tubes after that point are
called bronchioles.

148
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:00,062
These are bronchioles.

149
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:03,062
So for example, that we could
call a bronchiole.

150
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:05,022
And there's nothing
fancy here.

151
00:07:05,022 --> 00:07:07,037
It's just a pipe that
just gets thinner

152
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:08,011
and thinner and thinner.

153
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,092
We've labeled the different
parts of the pipes different

154
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:13,037
things, but the idea is, let's
take it through our mouth or

155
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:16,001
our nose and we just keep
dividing and keep dividing

156
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,031
this main division into two
different paths that takes us

157
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,055
into each of our lungs.

158
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:24,000
Let me draw this guy's
lungs here.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,025


160
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,058
And these bronchi-- or the
bronchi split into the lungs--

161
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:39,072
the bronchioles are in the
lungs and eventually the

162
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:41,066
bronchioles terminate.

163
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,001
And this is where it
gets interesting.

164
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,050
They keep dividing smaller and
smaller, thinner and thinner

165
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:52,011
and thinner, into these little
air sacs, just like that.

166
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:55,076
At the end of every super small
bronchiole are these

167
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:59,050
little air sacs-- super small
air sacs-- and I'm going to

168
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,006
talk about these air
sacs in a second.

169
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,031
And these are called alveoli.

170
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:08,089


171
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,069
So I've used a lot of
fancy words, but the

172
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,086
general idea is simple.

173
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:13,005
Air comes in through a pipe.

174
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:15,001
The pipe gets thinner and
thinner and thinner and they

175
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,075
end up at these little
air sacs.

176
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:20,044
And you're saying, well,
how does that get the

177
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:22,093
oxygen into my system?

178
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:26,045
Well, the key here is that these
air sacs are super small

179
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:30,094
and have very, very, very
thin walls-- or

180
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,005
I guess thin membranes.

181
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:33,070
So let me zoom in.

182
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,074
So if I were to zoom in on one
of these alveoli-- and just to

183
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:39,095
give you an idea, these are
super duper duper small.

184
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:43,079
I've drawn them fairly large
here, but each alveoli-- let

185
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,092
me draw a little bit bigger.

186
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,077
Let me draw these air sacs.

187
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,084
So you have these air
sacs like this.

188
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:54,002


189
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:56,028
And then you have a
bronchiole that's

190
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:57,060
terminating in that air sac.

191
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,032
Maybe a bronchiole is
terminating in another air sac

192
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:04,082
just like that-- another set
of air sacs just like that.

193
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:10,029
Each of these are only 200 to
300 microns in diameter.

194
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,052
So that distance right there--
let me switch colors-- that

195
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:18,072
distance right there is
200 to 300 microns.

196
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:22,004
And in case you don't know what
a micron is, a micron is

197
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:25,020
a millionth of a meter--
or you can view it as a

198
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,082
thousandth of a millimeter.

199
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:30,034
So this is 200 thousandths
of a millimeter.

200
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:32,088
Or you can think of them as--
and this is actually a very

201
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:38,073
easy way to visualize it-- this
is about one fifth of a

202
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,091
millimeter.

203
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,078
So if I actually try to draw it
on the screen-- if you made

204
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:47,060
this full screen, a millimeter
is about that far.

205
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,069
Maybe a little farther
than that.

206
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,012
Maybe about that far.

207
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,052
So imagine a fifth of that and
that's what we're talking

208
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:54,058
about the diameter of
one of these things.

209
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:56,047
And just to put it in the
whole scheme relative to

210
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,033
cells, the average
cell in the human

211
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,075
body is about 10 microns.

212
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:04,045
So this is only about 20 or 30
cells in diameter or relative

213
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,060
to the average cell
in the human body.

214
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,036
So these have a super
thin membrane.

215
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:12,017


216
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:15,048
If you view them as balloons,
the balloon is very thin--

217
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:20,025
pretty much one cell thick and
they're connected to the

218
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,040
bloodflow-- or actually, a
better way to think about is

219
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,053
that our circulatory system
passes right next to each of

220
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,010
these things.

221
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,058
So you have blood vessels that
come from the heart and they

222
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,086
want to be oxygenated.

223
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:37,080
In general, the blood vessels
that don't have oxygen-- and

224
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,089
I'm going to do this in a lot
more detail when I make the

225
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,025
videos about the heart and our
circulation system-- the blood

226
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,057
vessels that don't have oxygen--
de-oxygenated blood

227
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:46,041
is a little bit darker.

228
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,076
It looks a little
bit purplish.

229
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,039
So I'll draw it as blue.

230
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:55,088
So these are vessels that are
coming from the heart.

231
00:10:55,088 --> 00:11:00,005
So this blood right here has no
oxygen in it or it's been

232
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:02,064
de-oxygenated or it has very
little oxygen in it.

233
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:06,051
And the word for the blood
vessels that comes from the

234
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,000
heart are arteries.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,075
Let me write that down.

236
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:11,028
I'll review that again when
we cover it in the heart.

237
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:21,059
So arteries are blood vessels
from the heart.

238
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,022


239
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,076
And you've probably
heard of arteries.

240
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:29,019
Vessels that go to the heart
are called veins.

241
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:36,000


242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,015
This is really important to keep
in mind because later on,

243
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:42,026
you're going to see that
arteries don't always carry

244
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:45,010
oxygen or they're always not
de-oxygenated and veins always

245
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,089
aren't one way or the other.

246
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,051
We're going to go into a lot
more detail when we actually

247
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:49,077
cover the heart and the
circulatory system, but just

248
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:51,062
remember, arteries go away.

249
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:53,050
Veins go to the heart.

250
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,061
So here, these are arteries
going away from the heart to

251
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:03,001
the lungs, to the alveoli
because they want the blood

252
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,030
that's traveling in them
to get oxygen.

253
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,072
So what's going to happen is
that the air is flowing

254
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:16,005
through the bronchioles and
circulating around the

255
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:20,064
alveoli, filling the alveoli--
and as they fill the alveoli,

256
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:27,067
the little molecules of oxygen
are allowed to cross the

257
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:30,022
membrane of the alveoli
and essentially be

258
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,052
absorbed into the blood.

259
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:33,085
I'll do a lot more on that when
we talk about hemoglobin

260
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,074
and red blood cells, but you
just have to realize that

261
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,091
there's just a lot
of capillaries.

262
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,080
Capillaries are just super small
blood vessels that allow

263
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,085
air to pass-- essentially oxygen
and carbon dioxide

264
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,055
molecules to pass
between them.

265
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:48,058
These have a lot of capillaries
on them that allow

266
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,045
the exchange of gases.

267
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:56,047
So the oxygen can go into this
blood and so once the oxygen--

268
00:12:56,047 --> 00:13:00,030
so this is the vessel that's
coming from the heart and then

269
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,010
it's just a tube.

270
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,071
So then once it gets the oxygen,
it's going to go back

271
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,096
to the heart.

272
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:09,088


273
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,078
And so essentially this is the
point where this vessel, this

274
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,084
pipe, part of our circulatory
system, goes from being an

275
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:19,074
artery-- because it's coming
from the heart-- to a vein

276
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,032
because it's going back
to the heart.

277
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:26,000
And there's a special word for
these arteries and veins.

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,089
They're called pulmonary
arteries and veins.

279
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:34,098
So going away from the heart to
the lungs, to the alveoli,

280
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:40,084
these are the pulmonary
arteries.

281
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:44,077
And going back to the heart
are the pulmonary veins.

282
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:49,079


283
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,009
Now you're saying, Sal, what
does pulmonary mean?

284
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,091
Well, pulmo comes from the
Latin for the lungs.

285
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:59,009
It literally means the arteries
that are of the lungs

286
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,037
or that go to the lungs
and the veins that

287
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:02,029
come from the lungs.

288
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,084
So anytime people talk about
pulmonary anything, they're

289
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:09,020
talking about our lungs-- or
maybe something related to how

290
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,076
we breathe.

291
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:13,020
So it's a good word to know.

292
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:19,029
So anyway, you have your oxygen
coming in through your

293
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,066
mouth or your nose, through the
pharynx-- it could fill

294
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,020
your stomach.

295
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,054
We can blow up our stomach
like a balloon, but that

296
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:29,014
doesn't help us actually get
oxygen to our blood stream.

297
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:32,099
But the oxygen will come through
our larynx, into our

298
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:36,026
trachea, through the bronchi,
eventually in bronchioles,

299
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:40,012
ending up in alveoli and being
able to be absorbed into what

300
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,057
where the arteries, but then
we're going to go back and

301
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,049
then essentially oxygenate
the blood.

302
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:50,013
The red blood cells become red
once the hemoglobin becomes

303
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:53,098
very red or scarlet once it
actually has the oxygen and

304
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:55,029
then we go back.

305
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,013
But at the same time, this
isn't just about getting

306
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:01,085
oxygen into our arteries
or onto the hemoglobin.

307
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:05,011
It's also about releasing
carbon dioxide.

308
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:10,061
So these blue arteries coming
from the lungs are also going

309
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:14,073
to release carbon dioxide
into the alveoli.

310
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,055
And these will be exhaled.

311
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,036
So we have oxygen coming in.

312
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:21,097


313
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:24,011
Other things will be coming in,
but the O2 is what gets

314
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,078
absorbed in the alveoli.

315
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,067
And then when we breathe out,
we're going to have carbon

316
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:33,085
dioxide that was in our blood,
but then it gets absorbed into

317
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,084
the alveoli and they
get squeezed out.

318
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,068
I'm going to tell you in a
second how it gets squeezed.

319
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:43,032


320
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:46,012
It's actually that squeezing out
that actually-- when the

321
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:51,015
air goes back out, it can
vibrate my vocal cords and

322
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,021
it'll allow me to talk, but I'm
not going to go into too

323
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,062
much detail about that.

324
00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:58,020
So the last thing to consider
about this whole pulmonary

325
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:04,036
system or about our lungs is,
how does it force the air in

326
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,069
and how does it force
the air out?

327
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:09,065
And the way it's done is really
kind of like a-- you

328
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:12,070
could imagine it's kind of a
pump or a balloon-- is that we

329
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,067
have this huge layer
of flat muscles.

330
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:17,016
Let me pick a good color here.

331
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:25,086


332
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,039
Right below the lungs--
and this is

333
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,064
called a thoracic diaphragm.

334
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:38,032


335
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:41,027
And so when it's relaxed, it
kind of has this arch shape,

336
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,070
and so the lungs are kind
of squeezed in.

337
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,044
They don't have a
lot of volume.

338
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:49,037
But when I essentially breathe
in, what's happening is this

339
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:52,016
thoracic diaphragm is contracted
and when it's

340
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,095
contracted, it gets shorter, but
more importantly, it opens

341
00:16:55,095 --> 00:17:00,044
up the space where
my lungs are.

342
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:02,033
So my lungs can fill
up that space.

343
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,092
So what it does is, it
essentially-- it's like

344
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:07,042
pulling a balloon larger,
making the

345
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:10,006
volume of my lungs larger.

346
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:13,030
And when you make the volume of
something larger-- so the

347
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,000
lungs will become larger as
my thoracic diaphragm is

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,063
contracted and it kind of arches
down, creates more

349
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:22,015
space-- and as the volume of
something becomes larger, the

350
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:24,014
pressure inside of
them goes down.

351
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:26,042
If you remember from physics,
the pressure

352
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,072
times volume is a constant.

353
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:31,027


354
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:39,004
So when we breathe in, our brain
is essentially telling

355
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,029
our diaphragm to contract.

356
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:48,054


357
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:51,012
We have more space
around our lungs.

358
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:56,039
Our lungs expand to
fill the space.

359
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,086
We have less pressure here than
we have outside-- or you

360
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:01,053
can view it as negative
pressure.

361
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:04,044
So air always wants to go from
high pressure to low pressure

362
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:07,005
and so air is going to
flow into our lungs.

363
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:10,071
And hopefully there'll be some
oxygen there that can then

364
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:13,052
essentially go into our alveoli
and end up in our

365
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:17,019
arteries and then go back in the
veins as oxygen attached

366
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:17,081
to hemoglobin.

367
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:19,052
I'll talk more about
that in detail.

368
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,096
And then when we stop
contracting the diaphragm, it

369
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,098
goes back to this
arched position.

370
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:25,001
It contracts.

371
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,054
It's kind of like
a rubber band.

372
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:30,048
It contracts back the lungs and
it essentially expels the

373
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:33,077
air back and now that air's
going to have a lot more

374
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,011
carbon dioxide.

375
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:39,013
And just to get a sense of-- I
can look at my lungs-- I can't

376
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:42,013
look at them, but they
don't seem too large.

377
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:45,034
How do I get enough oxygen in
them-- and the key is, is that

378
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:52,008
because of this branching
process and the alveoli, the

379
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:55,092
inside surface area of the lungs
are actually much larger

380
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:59,030
than you can imagine-- or
actually than I could have

381
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,082
imagined had someone
not told me.

382
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,008
So it actually turns out-- I
looked it up-- the internal

383
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:08,065
surface area of your alveoli--
so the total surface area

384
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,047
where the oxygen can be absorbed
in or the carbon

385
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:13,095
dioxide can be absorbed out from
the blood-- it's actually

386
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:18,060
75 square meters.

387
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,091
That's meters, not feet.

388
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,047


389
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,073
If you think about it, that's
like a-- imagine some type of

390
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:26,030
a tarp or a field.

391
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,093
That's almost nine
by nine meters.

392
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:36,033
That's almost 27 by
27 square feet.

393
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,052
That's the size of some
people's backyards.

394
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,014
That's how much surface air you
have inside of your lungs.

395
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,024
It's all folded up.

396
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:45,030
That's how it gets jammed into
what look like relatively

397
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,022
small lungs.

398
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,041
But that's what gives us enough
surface area for enough

399
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,068
of the air, enough of the
oxygen, to cross the alveoli

400
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:54,098
membrane into our blood system
and enough of the carbon

401
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:56,055
dioxide to go back in.

402
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:59,036
And just to have a sense of how
many alveoli we had-- I

403
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:02,024
told you that they're very
small-- we actually have 300

404
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:04,041
million in each lung.

405
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:09,034
In each lung, we have
300 million alveoli.

406
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:12,001
So anyway, hopefully that gives
you a decent sense of

407
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:16,023
how we at least get oxygen
into our blood system and

408
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,064
carbon dioxide out of it.

409
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:20,020
In the next video, I'll talk
more about our actual

410
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:26,051
circulatory system and how we
get the oxygen from the lungs

411
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:28,024
to the rest of the body and
how do we get the carbon

412
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:31,064
dioxide from the rest of the
body into the lungs?

413
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,009

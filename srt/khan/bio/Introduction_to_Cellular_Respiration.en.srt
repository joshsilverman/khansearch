1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040


2
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,025
In my humble opinion, the
single most important

3
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:11,053
biochemical reaction, especially
to us, is cellular

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,064
respiration.

5
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:17,048
And the reason why I feel so
strongly about that is because

6
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:21,017
this is how we derive
energy from what we

7
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,062
eat, or from our fuel.

8
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:25,028
Or if we want to be specific,
from glucose.

9
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:27,026
At the end of the day, most of
what we eat, or at least

10
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,028
carbohydrates, end
up as glucose.

11
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:32,018
In future videos I'll talk about
how we derive energy

12
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,063
from fats or proteins.

13
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:40,068
But cellular respiration, let's
us go from glucose to

14
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:43,035
energy and some other
byproducts.

15
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:45,017
And to be a little bit more
specific about it, let me

16
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:47,053
write the chemical reaction
right here.

17
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:51,084
So the chemical formula for
glucose, you're going to have

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:57,035
six carbons, twelve hydrogens
and six oxygens.

19
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:59,099
So that's your glucose
right there.

20
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:02,088
So if you had one mole of
glucose-- let me write that,

21
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:06,087
that's your glucose right
there-- and then to that one

22
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:12,001
mole of glucose, if you had six
moles of molecular oxygen

23
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:16,007
running around the cell, then--
and this is kind of a

24
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:19,010
gross simplification for
cellular respiration.

25
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,065
I think you're going to
appreciate over the course of

26
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:25,001
the next few videos, that one
can get as involved into this

27
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,020
mechanism as possible.

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,071
But I think it's nice to
get the big picture.

29
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:30,018
But if you give me some glucose,
if you have one mole

30
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:34,018
of glucose and six moles of
oxygen, through the process of

31
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:37,029
cellular respiration-- and so
I'm just writing it as kind of

32
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:40,045
a big black box right now,
let me pick a nice color.

33
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:45,015
So this is cellular
respiration.

34
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:47,003
Which we'll see is
quite involved.

35
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,048
But I guess anything can be, if
you want to be particular

36
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:50,070
enough about it.

37
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,023
Through cellular respiration
we're going to produce six

38
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:58,040
moles of carbon dioxide.

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,046
Six moles of water.

40
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:05,078
And-- this is the
super-important part-- we're

41
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,081
going to produce energy.

42
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,093
We're going to produce energy.

43
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:14,053
And this is the energy that can
be used to do useful work,

44
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:18,075
to heat our bodies, to
provide electrical

45
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,000
impulses in our brains.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,059
Whatever energy, especially a
human body needs, but it's not

47
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,090
just humans, is provided
by this

48
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,059
cellular respiration mechanism.

49
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:31,012
And when you say energy, you
might say, hey Sal, on the

50
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,072
last video didn't you just--
well, if that was the last

51
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:38,087
video you watched, you probably
saw that I said ATP

52
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:48,008
is the energy currency for
biological systems. And so you

53
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:50,028
might say, hey, well it looks
like glucose is the energy

54
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:53,059
currency for biological systems.
And to some degree,

55
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:56,096
both answers would be correct.

56
00:02:56,096 --> 00:03:00,043
But to just see how it fits
together is that the process

57
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:03,081
of cellular respiration, it does
produce energy directly.

58
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:07,068
But that energy is used
to produce ATP.

59
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:11,027
So if I were to break down
this energy portion of

60
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:13,078
cellular respiration right
there, some of it

61
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,008
would just be heat.

62
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,099
You know, it just warms
up the cell.

63
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,071
And then some of it is used--
and this is what the textbooks

64
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,022
will tell you.

65
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:25,000
The textbooks will say
it produces 38 ATPs.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,078
It can be more readily used by
cells to contract muscles or

67
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:33,008
to generate nerve impulses or
do whatever else-- grow, or

68
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:35,034
divide, or whatever else
the cell might need.

69
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:37,003
So really, cellular respiration,
to say it

70
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:39,019
produces energy, a little
disingenuous.

71
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,019
It's really the process of
taking glucose and producing

72
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,080
ATPs, with maybe heat
as a byproduct.

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,094
But it's probably nice to
have that heat around.

74
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:50,003
We need to be reasonably warm
in order for our cells to

75
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,028
operate correctly.

76
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:55,046
So the whole point is really to
go from glucose, from one

77
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,002
mole of glucose-- and
the textbooks will

78
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:01,027
tell you-- to 38 ATPs.

79
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:05,053
And the reality is, this is in
the ideal circumstances that

80
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:07,091
you'll produce 38 ATPs.

81
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,024
I was reading up a little bit
before doing this video.

82
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:13,062
And the reality is, depending on
the efficiency of the cell

83
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:17,056
in performing cellular
respiration, it'll probably be

84
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:20,057
more on the order of
29 to 30 ATPs.

85
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:23,030
But there's a huge variation
here and people are really

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,054
still studying this idea.

87
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:27,047
But this is all cellular
respiration is.

88
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,045
In the next few videos we're
going to break it down into

89
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,030
its kind of constituent parts.

90
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,025
And I'm going to introduce them
to you right now, just so

91
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:36,050
you realize that these are parts
of cellular respiration.

92
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,083
The first stage is called
glycolysis.

93
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:43,014


94
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:45,087
Which literally means
breaking up glucose.

95
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:49,018
And just so you know, this part,
the glyco for glucose

96
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:56,051
and then lysis means
to break up.

97
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:59,050
When you saw hydrolysis, it
means using water to break up

98
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,048
a molecule.

99
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:03,044
Glycolysis means we're going
to be breaking up glucose.

100
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:06,049
And in case you care about
things like word origins,

101
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:12,004
glucose comes from, the gluc
part of glucose comes from

102
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:13,098
Greek for sweet.

103
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,036
And glucose is indeed sweet.

104
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:20,036
And then all sugars, we
put this ose ending.

105
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,094
So that just means sugar.

106
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:24,093
So you might think it's kind
of a redundant statement to

107
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:25,085
say sweet sugar.

108
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,055
But there are some sugars
that aren't sweet.

109
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,062
For example, lactose.

110
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,094
Milk, it might be a little bit,
but when you actually

111
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:35,086
digest lactose then you can turn
it into an actual sweet

112
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:39,081
sugar, but it doesn't taste
sweet like glucose or fructose

113
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:41,076
or sucrose would taste.

114
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,043
But anyway, that's an aside.

115
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,037
But the first step of cellular
respiration is glycolysis,

116
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:48,082
breaking up of glucose.

117
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:53,095
What it does is, it breaks up
the glucose from a 6-carbon

118
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:57,035
molecule-- so it literally
takes it from a 6-carbon

119
00:05:57,035 --> 00:06:02,051
molecule-- let me draw it like
this-- a 6-carbon molecule

120
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,049
that looks like this.

121
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,049
And it's actually a cycle.

122
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:08,000
Let me show you what glucose
actually looks like.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,097
This is glucose right here.

124
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:13,083
And notice you have
one, two, three,

125
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,023
four, five, six carbons.

126
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,048
I got this off of Wikipedia.

127
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:20,029
Just look up glucose and you
can see this diagram if you

128
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,056
want to kind of see
the details.

129
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:25,064
You can see you have six
carbons, six oxygens.

130
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:28,026
That's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

131
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:29,085
And then all these
little small blue

132
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:31,062
things are my hydrogens.

133
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:34,025
So that's what glucose
actually looks like.

134
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:37,006
But the process of glycolysis,
you're essentially just

135
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:40,027
taking-- I'm writing it out
as a string, but you could

136
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:43,038
imagine it as a chain-- and it
has oxygens and hydrogens

137
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,041
added to each of
these carbons.

138
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,051
But it has a carbon backbone.

139
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,091
And it breaks that carbon
backbone in two.

140
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:54,004


141
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,018
That's what glycolysis
does, right there.

142
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:00,024
So you've kind of lysed
the glucose and

143
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:01,026
each of these things.

144
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:02,061
And I haven't drawn all
the other stuff

145
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,064
that's added on to that.

146
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:06,042
You know, these things are all
bonded to other things, with

147
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,000
oxygens and hydrogens
and whatever.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,039
But each of these 3-carbon
backbone

149
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,087
molecules are called pyruvate.

150
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:13,036
We'll go into a lot more
detail on that.

151
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:20,000
But glycolysis, it by itself
generates-- well,

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,037
it needs two ATPs.

153
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:26,007


154
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:32,024
And it generates four ATPs.

155
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:38,016
So on a net basis, it generates
two-- let me write

156
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:46,092
this in a different color--
it generates two net ATPs.

157
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,099
So that's the first stage.

158
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,018
And this can occur completely
in the absence of oxygen.

159
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:53,089
I'll do a whole video on
glycolysis in the future.

160
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,054
Then these byproducts, they get

161
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,063
re-engineered a little bit.

162
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:59,005
And then they enter into what's
called the Krebs cycle.

163
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:05,010


164
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,081
Which generates another
two ATPs.

165
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:12,074
And then, and this is kind of
the interesting point, there's

166
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,032
another process that
you can say happens

167
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,039
after the Krebs cycle.

168
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,037
But we're in a cell and
everything's bumping into

169
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:19,054
everything all of the time.

170
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:23,013
But it's normally viewed
to be after glycolysis

171
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:23,057
and the Krebs cycle.

172
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:26,047
And this requires oxygen.

173
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:31,066


174
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:33,095
So let me be clear, glycolysis,
this first step,

175
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,075
no oxygen required.

176
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:40,051
Doesn't need oxygen.

177
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,038
It can occur with oxygen
or without it.

178
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,030
Oxygen not needed.

179
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,040


180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,084
Or you could say this is called
an anaerobic process.

181
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:52,067
This is the anaerobic part
of the respiration.

182
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,058
Let me write that down too.

183
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:55,063
Anaerobic.

184
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:57,010
Maybe I'll write
that down here.

185
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,071
Glycolysis, since it doesn't
need oxygen, we

186
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,045
can say it's anaerobic.

187
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,025
You might be familiar with the
idea of aerobic exercise.

188
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,045
The whole idea of aerobic
exercise is to make you

189
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:13,062
breathe hard because you
need a lot of oxygen

190
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,050
to do aerobic exercise.

191
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,089
So anaerobic means you
don't need oxygen.

192
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,049
Aerobic means it needs oxygen.

193
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,088
Anaerobic means the opposite.

194
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:22,012
You don't need oxygen.

195
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,044
So, glycolysis anaerobic.

196
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:29,023
And it produces two ATPs net.

197
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:35,016
And then you go to the Krebs
cycle, there's a little bit of

198
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,014
setup involved here.

199
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,030
And we'll do the detail
of that in the future.

200
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,075
But then you move over to the
Krebs cycle, which is aerobic.

201
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,085
It is aerobic.

202
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:48,014
It requires oxygen
to be around.

203
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:51,044
And then this produces
two ATPs.

204
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,064
And then this is the part that,
frankly, when I first

205
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,077
learned it, confused me a lot.

206
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:57,009
But I'll just write it
in order the way it's

207
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:57,088
traditionally written.

208
00:09:57,088 --> 00:10:00,028
Then you have something called--
we're using the same

209
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:03,028
colors too much-- you have
something called the electron

210
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,053
transport chain.

211
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:11,065


212
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,091
And this part gets credit
for producing

213
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,034
the bulk of the ATPs.

214
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:19,022
34 ATPs.

215
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:22,045
And this is also aerobic.

216
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,071
It requires oxygen.

217
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:26,046
So you can see, if you had no
oxygen, if the cells weren't

218
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:28,046
getting enough oxygen,
you can produce a

219
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,079
little bit of energy.

220
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,048
But it's nowhere near as much
as you can produce once you

221
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,098
have the oxygen.

222
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:39,023
And actually when you start
running out of oxygen, this

223
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:42,050
can't proceed forward, so what
happens is some of these

224
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,072
byproducts of glycolysis,
instead of going into the

225
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:48,000
Krebs cycle and the electron
transport chain, where they

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,062
need oxygen, instead they go
through a side process called

227
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:52,087
fermentation.

228
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:55,048


229
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:58,055
For some organisms, this process
of fermentation takes

230
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:00,047
your byproducts of
glycolysis and

231
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,010
literally produces alcohol.

232
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,025
That's where alcohol
comes from.

233
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,050
That's called alcohol
fermentation.

234
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,012
And we, as human beings,
I guess fortunately or

235
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:12,040
unfortunately, our muscles do
not directly produce alcohol.

236
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,089
They produce lactic acid.

237
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,003
So we do lactic acid
fermentation.

238
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:18,014
Let me write that down.

239
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:19,025
Lactic acid.

240
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:23,053
That's humans and probably
other mammals.

241
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:30,023
But other things like yeast will
do alcohol fermentation.

242
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:34,051


243
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,064
So this is when you
don't have oxygen.

244
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:38,084
It's actually this lactic acid
that if I were to sprint

245
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:41,007
really hard and not be able to
get enough oxygen, that my

246
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,088
muscles start to ache because
this lactic acid

247
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:45,037
starts to build up.

248
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,027
But that's just a side thing.

249
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:49,004
If we have oxygen we can move
to the Krebs cycle, get our

250
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,095
two ATPs, and then go on to the
electron transport chain

251
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:56,021
and produce 34 ATPs, which is
really the bulk of what

252
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:57,092
happens in respiration.

253
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,008
Now I said this as an
aside, that to some

254
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,050
degree this isn't fair.

255
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,004
Because while these guys are
operating they're also

256
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,079
producing these other
molecules.

257
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,066
They're not producing them
entirely, but what they're

258
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:11,049
doing is, they're taking-- and
I know this gets complicated

259
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,047
here, but I think over the
course of the next few videos

260
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:16,088
we'll get an intuition for it--
in these two parts of the

261
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:20,011
reaction, glycolysis and the
Krebs cycle, we're constantly

262
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:24,082
taking NAD-- I'll write it as
NAD plus-- and we're adding

263
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:28,047
hydrogens to it to form NADH.

264
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,066
And this actually happens for
one molecule of glucose, this

265
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,052
happens to 10 NADs.

266
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:38,003
Or 10 NAD plusses
to become NADHs.

267
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:40,000
And those are actually
what drive the

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,033
electron transport chain.

269
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,087
And I'll talk a lot more about
it and kind of how that

270
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:47,045
happens and why is energy being
derived and how is this

271
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:49,021
an oxidative reaction
and all of that.

272
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,050
And what's getting oxidized
and what's being reduced.

273
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,075
But I just wanted to
give due credit.

274
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:56,019
These guys aren't just producing
two ATPs in each of

275
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:56,067
these stages.

276
00:12:56,067 --> 00:13:00,092
They're also producing, actually
combined, 10 NADHs,

277
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:06,053
which each produce three ATPs
in an ideal situation, the

278
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,087
electron transport chain.

279
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:12,004
And they're also doing it to
this other molecule, FAD,

280
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,050
which is very similar.

281
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,002
But they're producing FADH.

282
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,061


283
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,028
Now I know all of this
is very complicated.

284
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll make videos on this
in the future.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,002
But the important thing to
remember is cellular

286
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:28,035
respiration, all it is is taking
glucose and kind of

287
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:31,057
repackaging the energy in
glucose, and repackaging it in

288
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:34,034
the form of, your textbooks
will tell you, 38 ATPs.

289
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:36,083
If you're doing an exam, that's
a good number to write.

290
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,034
It tends to, in reality
be a smaller number.

291
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,044
It's also going to
produce heat.

292
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,007
Actually most of it is
going to be heat.

293
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:45,067
But 38 ATPs, and it does it
through three stages.

294
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:48,054
The first stage is glycolysis,
where you're just literally

295
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:51,025
splitting the glucose
into two.

296
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,094
You're generating some ATPs.

297
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:54,072
But the more important thing
is, you're generating some

298
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:57,039
NADHs that are going to be used
later in the electron

299
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,066
transport chain.

300
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:01,035
Then those byproducts are split
even more in the Krebs

301
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:04,024
cycle, directly producing
two ATPs.

302
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:06,026
But that produces a
lot more NADHs.

303
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:09,071
And all of those NADHs are used
in the electron transport

304
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:13,082
chain to produce the
bulk of your energy

305
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:17,096
currency, or your 34 ATPs.

306
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,055

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,056


2
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:03,058
There's been a lot of talk very
recently, or definitely

3
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:05,094
over the last several years,
about the idea of intelligent

4
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:10,097
design and how it compares
to evolution.

5
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:14,058
And my goal in this video
isn't to enter into that

6
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:17,094
discussion, or it's actually
turned into an argument in

7
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:21,050
most circles, but really to make
my best attempt to kind

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,071
of reconcile the notions.

9
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,010
So the idea behind intelligent
design is really that there

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,025
are some things that we see in
our world that are just so

11
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:35,056
amazing that it seems hard to
believe that it could be the

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:39,039
product of a set of
random processes.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,013
And the example that tends to
be given is the human eye,

14
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:45,063
which truly is an awe-inspiring
device.

15
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:47,020
You can call it an organ
or a machine.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,082
Whatever you want to call
it, it does all of

17
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,067
these amazing things.

18
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:51,089
It can focus at different
lengths.

19
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:55,074
It brings the light into focus
at just the right spot, and

20
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:59,042
then you have your retinal
nerves and you have two eyes

21
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,025
so can see in stereoscopic
vision.

22
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:03,085
You can see in colors, and then
you can adjust to light

23
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:06,050
and dark, so the human eye
truly is awe inspiring.

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,001
And the argument tends to go
that, look, how can this be

25
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,045
created from random processes?

26
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,051
And the goal of this isn't to
trace the evolution of the

27
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,004
eye, but I'll do a little side
note here that evolution is--

28
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:19,014
and natural selection, and
I like the word natural

29
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,068
selection more because
it's not talking

30
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:22,092
about an active process.

31
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:26,070
Natural selection is acting over
eons and eons of time,

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,037
and we do see evidence in our
world of a progression of

33
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:32,045
different types of eyes.

34
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:36,093
In fact, all evidence shows
that the human eye is not

35
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:42,096
perfect, and that there
is variation.

36
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:45,023
I mean, we all know some of us
are nearsighted, some are

37
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:45,090
farsighted.

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,062
We have astigmatisms. It
degenerates over time.

39
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:51,075
People generate cataracts, so
there's a whole set of things

40
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,048
that can go wrong with
the human eye.

41
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:56,006
I'm not using that as a
rebuttal, but I'm just showing

42
00:01:56,006 --> 00:02:00,084
you that there is variation,
even in what I believe is

43
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:04,031
truly an amazing piece
of biology.

44
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,048
And even if you go outside of
the human world, there's

45
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,013
obviously a huge spectrum
of eyes.

46
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:13,056
You have fish at the bottom of
the ocean that have eyes that

47
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:16,040
are really just light sensors,
that barely can maybe tell

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,078
you-- and some insects are like
this-- whether there's

49
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,075
some light or some heat
around, nothing

50
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:21,094
really more than that.

51
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:23,084
And at the other end of the
spectrum, far better than

52
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:26,093
humans, you have certain birds
and a certain type of

53
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:29,065
nocturnal creatures where they
can see in the dark.

54
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:34,033
You know, maybe you have a
certain-- actually, all cats

55
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:37,008
have this reflective material in
their eye that allows them

56
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:39,056
much better night vision, so in
that way they're superior

57
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:41,071
to humans, and they can see just
as good as humans during

58
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,009
the daytime.

59
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,006
You have certain birds who can
see with far more visual

60
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,075
clarity at far better distances
than humans can, so

61
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,049
there is no perfect eye.

62
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,075
So I'll go into a little bit
of a theological argument

63
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,080
here, and for those of you who
watch my videos, you know that

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,037
I'm one to stray away from
theological arguments,

65
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:01,063
although I might eventually do
a whole philosophy playlist,

66
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:05,052
but I want to be very careful
not to offend anyone's

67
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,033
sensibilities, because
that truly, truly,

68
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,009
truly is not my intention.

69
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:13,043
But the whole point I want to
make is that, look, if you

70
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:16,031
believe in a God, and I won't
take sides on that argument in

71
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:23,003
this video right here, it's to
some degree, I would say,

72
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,063
almost disparaging of an
all-powerful being to say that

73
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:30,084
this human eye, it kind of gives
too much importance to

74
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,009
us as individuals.

75
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:37,043
I always think that religion--
and actually science.

76
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,053
Or actually everything.

77
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,047
I mean, we should be humble in
our lives, and there should be

78
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:44,094
the realization that we, as
humans, really-- this isn't

79
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:51,005
perfection, and to imply that
this is the best that a

80
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,021
perfect entity or an
all-powerful entity could

81
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:57,033
produce I think is a little
actually disparaging of it.

82
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,096
I'll give you another example.

83
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:01,059
I give you another example, and
I'll put my engineering

84
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,046
hat on here.

85
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:03,066
And once again, I want
to be very clear.

86
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:07,094
My goal isn't in this video to
say, oh, you know, look, hey,

87
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:11,012
evolution, random processes,
that by itself, there is no

88
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,084
God, and you just have
to live with it.

89
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,081
No, that's not my point.

90
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:18,016
I'm actually making the opposite
argument, that a

91
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:23,037
belief in God would not point
to a God who-- a belief in a

92
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:27,030
universal, all-powerful God
would not point to a God who

93
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,050
designs the particular, who
designs each particular.

94
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,063
And even more, the imperfections
that we see

95
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,079
around us would-- and especially
because we see

96
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,042
variation and they're being
selected for it.

97
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,094
I mean, we can't just
focus on the eye.

98
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:42,016
We would have to focus on
viruses and cancers, and it

99
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:46,045
would have to speak to a God
that is designing one off

100
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:50,099
every version of every sequence
of DNA that we see,

101
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:54,079
because if someone talks about
designing an eye, we know that

102
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,022
the eye is the byproduct of DNA,
and we know the DNA is a

103
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:04,094
sequence of base pairs, you
know, ATG, C, A, and, you

104
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:07,024
know, billions and
billions of them.

105
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,097
And so when we talk about
design, we would be talking

106
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:12,055
literally about designing
the sequence.

107
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:14,049
And we even know that a lot of
the sequence, there's some

108
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,023
noise in there.

109
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,020
We know that a lot of it comes
from primitive viruses deep in

110
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,088
our past.

111
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:22,080
So the argument I'm making here
is that in order to give

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,037
credit to the all powerful, at
least to my mind, a system

113
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:44,041
that comes from very simple and
elegant basic ideas like

114
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:50,005
natural selection and
variations, that in our DNA,

115
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,035
we call those mutations, in
the laws of physics and

116
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:58,008
chemistry, and those, from that
simple and elegant basic

117
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:03,035
ideas, for complexity
to emerge.

118
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,054
So this is one idea and this
is what really evolution

119
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:10,069
speaks to, that, look, our
universe is this profound

120
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,056
world, this profound
environment, where from these

121
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:18,075
very basic, simple, beautiful
ideas, we have this complexity

122
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:20,073
in the structure that is truly,

123
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:23,006
truly, truly awe inspiring.

124
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,002
This is, in my mind, what
evolution speaks to.

125
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:30,006
And in my mind, even as an
engineer, this speaks to a

126
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,093
higher form of design.

127
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:34,016
This speak to a more
profound design.

128
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:37,062


129
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:43,032
So this whole video, the whole
argument, is that if one does

130
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:46,020
believe in a God, and, you know,
I'm not going to take

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,086
sides in that in this video,
and a God that speaks to

132
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:58,006
beauty and elegance and is
infinitely powerful, then this

133
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:01,067
idea of the laws of physics
and chemistry and natural

134
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,091
selection, which is really-- I
mean, you know, when I talked

135
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,080
about natural selection in the
last video, it was really-- I

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,089
think you would find it was
a bit of common sense.

137
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:14,029
That this is a very profound
design and it speaks to the

138
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:19,016
art of the designer as opposed
to designing each of these

139
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,014
entities one off.

140
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,010
And what's even more profound
about the design

141
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,097
is that it's adaptive.

142
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:29,006
If there's environmental
stress, then the other

143
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:32,042
variations survive
more frequently.

144
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:35,093
And so it's never changing,
that perfection, that no

145
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:40,013
instance can ever be pointed to
and say this is the highest

146
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,082
point that this design
can reach.

147
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:44,048
That is always-- I don't want
to say getting better.

148
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:47,064
It's always getting more suited
to its environment as

149
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:50,083
it changes, and that to
me is a better design.

150
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,025
Now, just following
up on that, and I

151
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:53,097
want to be very clear.

152
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,045
This whole idea is to kind of
raise the standard of what we

153
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:59,023
expect out of design.

154
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:02,029
It's to kind of show other
points or other places in the

155
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:05,031
scientific or mathematical world
where this does emerge.

156
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,089
And the best example I see
of that is with fractals.

157
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,085
A lot of you-all might have
seen-- this is the Mandelbrot

158
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:14,061
set, a very famous
set of fractals.

159
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,023
It's immensely complex.

160
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:20,057
In fact, you can keep zooming
in on the Mandelbrot set at

161
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,037
any point, and when you zoom it
out, it becomes infinitely

162
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:26,093
complex, and you can explore
it indefinitely.

163
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:30,087
But the beauty of it, the true
beauty of it, is all of this

164
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:34,036
can be described by one
equation, one almost

165
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:40,040
shockingly simple equation, and
that's this: The next z is

166
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,034
equal to the z before
it squared plus 1.

167
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:47,008
And you're like you know, Sal,
you started talking about

168
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:50,007
intelligent design and evolution
and all of that.

169
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,050
Why are you all of a sudden
breaking into fractals?

170
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,034
And the point I'm trying to make
here is that if I had two

171
00:08:57,034 --> 00:09:01,027
designers and one set out to
go and paint this exact

172
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,071
particular fractal and say,
oh, you know, I'm going to

173
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:05,062
make this brown and I'm going
to make this blue and I'm

174
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:07,095
going to make this a circle
with other circles, you'd

175
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,042
think this is an amazing
painter.

176
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:15,059
For example, if you were to go
to someone 300 years ago and

177
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,091
you were to show them this, they
would say that this is

178
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,037
the finest design that anyone
might have ever been able to

179
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:23,077
devise, because it's so
infinitely complex.

180
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:27,014
But now we know that this can
be completely described by

181
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:29,087
this simple equation,
literally.

182
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,001
For those of you are interested,
all they're doing,

183
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:37,016
this is a complex plane, and
they're starting at zero--

184
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,088
excuse me, not plus 1, plus c.

185
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:41,001
Let me make that very clear.

186
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,016
This is the equation plus c.

187
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,099
So for every point on the
complex plane, you put that

188
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:50,085
point in for c, and then you
start with zero, and you keep

189
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:51,036
doing this.

190
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:53,086
So you say zero squared plus
that number, that complex

191
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:55,010
number, is equal to that.

192
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,023
Then you put that in here, and
then you do that number

193
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,028
squared plus that complex
number, and you do it again.

194
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:01,004
You do it over and
over and over.

195
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:05,011
So turns out that some numbers
don't go to infinity and those

196
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:06,051
numbers are in black.

197
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,086
They're considered part
of the Mandelbrot set.

198
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:12,078
And then the numbers that do go
to infinity, as you iterate

199
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,012
on this formula, you color it
based on how fast it goes to

200
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:20,079
infinity, and it creates this
infinitely beautiful and

201
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,063
complex pattern.

202
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:26,019
Now, if you were to say what is
a more profound design, and

203
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,063
you can ask any engineer this,
in my mind, this is the most

204
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,084
profound design.

205
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:34,061
Because it's simple and elegant,
but it describes

206
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:38,010
something of infinite
complexity.

207
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,058
It's not just focused on the
particular, it's focused on

208
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,000
kind of the metalevel.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,027
It's focused on creating just
the idea of which this is just

210
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:48,026
an example.

211
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:55,067
So anyway, this is probably my
video where I steer most away

212
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:59,069
from the science of it all and
maybe I focus a little bit

213
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:01,025
more on the slightly

214
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,061
metaphysical or the awe inspiring.

215
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,028
But my whole point here is to
really throw out my little

216
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,044
idea of how you can reconcile
these notions.

217
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:13,035
That evolution, the randomness
of it, does not speak to a

218
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:15,027
Godless universe, although
I'm not going to

219
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:16,028
take sides on that.

220
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:20,092
It speaks to a more profound
God, in my mind.

221
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:27,016
So anyway, forgive me for taking
my liberties, and I

222
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,071
want to make it very clear, I
don't want to offend anyone's

223
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,090
sensibilities, but I really
just wanted to throw

224
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,070
this idea out there.

225
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,044
See you in the next video.

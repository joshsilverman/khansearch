1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,055


2
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:04,009
Before I dive into the mechanics
of how cells divide,

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,080
I think it could be useful to
talk a little bit about a lot

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,073
of the vocabulary that
surrounds DNA.

5
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:12,030
There's a lot of words and some
of them kind of sound

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,051
like each other, but they
can be very confusing.

7
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:16,060
So the first few I'd like to
talk about is just about how

8
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,023
DNA either generates more DNA,
makes copies of itself, or how

9
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:24,057
it essentially makes proteins,
and we've talked about this in

10
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,021
the DNA video.

11
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:29,033
So let's say I have a little--
I'm just going to draw a small

12
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,070
section of DNA.

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:37,074
I have an A, a G, a T, let's say
I have two T's and then I

14
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,092
have two C's.

15
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:40,000
Just some small section.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,039
It keeps going.

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,000
And, of course, it's
a double helix.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,043
It has its corresponding
bases.

19
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,078
Let me do that in this color.

20
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:53,039
So A corresponds to T, G with
C, it forms hydrogen bonds

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:01,032
with C, T with A, T with
A, C with G, C with G.

22
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:03,028
And then, of course,
it just keeps

23
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:05,048
going on in that direction.

24
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,076
So there's a couple of different
processes that this

25
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:09,031
DNA has to do.

26
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,043
One is when you're just dealing
with your body cells

27
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:16,062
and you need to make more
versions of your skin cells,

28
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:21,054
your DNA has to copy itself,
and this process is called

29
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:22,051
replication.

30
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,092
You're replicating the DNA.

31
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:26,018
So let me do replication.

32
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:28,065
So how can this DNA
copy itself?

33
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:30,075
And this is one of the beautiful
things about how DNA

34
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:32,031
is structured.

35
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:34,076
Replication.

36
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:37,012
So I'm doing a gross
oversimplification, but the

37
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,059
idea is these two strands
separate, and it doesn't

38
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,023
happen on its own.

39
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:43,051
It's facilitated by a bunch of
proteins and enzymes, but I'll

40
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,051
talk about the details of the

41
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:48,060
microbiology in a future video.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,074
So these guys separate
from each other.

43
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:57,028
Let me put it up here.

44
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:58,059
They separate from each other.

45
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:02,018
Let me take the other guy.

46
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,070
Too big.

47
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,043
That guy looks something
like that.

48
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,005
They separate from each other,
and then once they've

49
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,068
separated from each other,
what could happen?

50
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:16,094
Let me delete some of that
stuff over here.

51
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,090
Delete that stuff right there.

52
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,059
So you have this double helix.

53
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,040
They were all connected.

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,022
They're base pairs.

55
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:23,097
Now, they separate
from each other.

56
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:26,000
Now once they separate, what
can each of these do?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,050
They can now become the template
for each other.

58
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,062


59
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:35,040
If this guy is sitting by
himself, now all of a sudden,

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,075
a thymine base might come and
join right here, so these

61
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,011
nucleotides will start
lining up.

62
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:46,063
So you'll have a thymine and a
cytosine, and then an adenine,

63
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:49,075
adenine, guanine, guanine,
and it'll keep happening.

64
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:53,083
And then on this other part,
this other green strand that

65
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,021
was formerly attached to this
blue strand, the same thing

66
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:56,096
will happen.

67
00:02:56,096 --> 00:03:01,066
You have an adenine, a guanine,
thymine, thymine,

68
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,077
cytosine, cytosine.

69
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,055
So what just happened?

70
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:06,046
By separating and then just
attracting their complementary

71
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:10,066
bases, we just duplicated
this molecule, right?

72
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:13,028
We'll do the microbiology of it
in the future, but this is

73
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,003
just to get the idea.

74
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:17,037
This is how the DNA makes
copies of itself.

75
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:20,018
And especially when we talk
about mitosis and meiosis, I

76
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:22,003
might say, oh, this is the stage
where the replication

77
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:23,028
has occurred.

78
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:26,046
Now, the other thing that
you'll hear a lot, and I

79
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:32,090
talked about this in the DNA
video, is transcription.

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,000
In the DNA video, I didn't focus
much on how does DNA

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,072
duplicate itself, but one of
the beautiful things about

82
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:41,041
this double helix design is
it really is that easy to

83
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,015
duplicate itself.

84
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:46,066
You just split the two strips,
the two helices, and then they

85
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,075
essentially become a template
for the other one, and then

86
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,040
you have a duplicate.

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,019
Now, transcription is what needs
to occur for this DNA

88
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,037
eventually to turn into
proteins, but transcription is

89
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,087
the intermediate step.

90
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:05,028
It's the step where you
go from DNA to mRNA.

91
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,093
And then that mRNA leaves the
nucleus of the cell and goes

92
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:12,081
out to the ribosomes, and I'll
talk about that in a second.

93
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:13,081
So we can do the same thing.

94
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:15,075
So this guy, once again
during transcription,

95
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:18,012
will also split apart.

96
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:24,097
So that was one split there and
then the other split is

97
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,022
right there.

98
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:31,026


99
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:34,024
And actually, maybe it makes
more sense just to do one-half

100
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,087
of it, so let me delete that.

101
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:41,044


102
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,073
Let's say that we're just going
to transcribe the green

103
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:46,000
side right here.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,069
Let me erase all this stuff
right-- nope, wrong color.

105
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,052
Let me erase this stuff
right here.

106
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:59,086
Now, what happens is instead
of having deoxyribonucleic

107
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:05,002
acid nucleotides pair up with
this DNA strand, you have

108
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,094
ribonucleic acid, or RNA
pair up with this.

109
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:11,062
And I'll do RNA in magneta.

110
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,012
So the RNA will pair
up with it.

111
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:19,048
And so thymine on the DNA side
will pair up with adenine.

112
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,081
Guanine, now, when we talk about
RNA, instead of thymine,

113
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:27,016
we have uracil, uracil,
cytosine, cytosine, and it

114
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:28,007
just keeps going.

115
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,032
This is mRNA.

116
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:33,020


117
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,006
Now, this separates.

118
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:38,094
That mRNA separates, and
it leaves the nucleus.

119
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:43,049
It leaves the nucleus, and then
you have translation.

120
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:49,075


121
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:53,079
That is going from the mRNA to--
you remember in the DNA

122
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,027
video, I had the little tRNA.

123
00:05:56,027 --> 00:06:01,064
The transfer RNA were kind of
the trucks that drove up the

124
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:05,010
amino acids to the mRNA, and
this all occurs inside these

125
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,014
parts of the cell called
the ribosome.

126
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,002
But the translation is
essentially going from the

127
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:16,070
mRNA to the proteins, and we
saw how that happened.

128
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,056
You have this guy-- let
me make a copy here.

129
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,087
Let me actually copy
the whole thing.

130
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:32,098
This guy separates, leaves the
nucleus, and then you had

131
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:37,006
those little tRNA trucks that
essentially drive up.

132
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,081
So maybe I have some tRNA.

133
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:41,042
Let's see, adenine, adenine,
guanine, and guanine.

134
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,043
This is tRNA.

135
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:44,023
That's a codon.

136
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:46,064
A codon has three base pairs,
and attached to it, it has

137
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,054
some amino acid.

138
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,075
And then you have some
other piece of tRNA.

139
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:54,088
Let's say it's a uracil,
cytosine, adenine.

140
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:57,030
And attached to that, it has
a different amino acid.

141
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,085


142
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,052
Then the amino acids attach to
each other, and then they form

143
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:09,036
this long chain of amino acids,
which is a protein, and

144
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:12,083
the proteins form these weird
and complicated shapes.

145
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:17,007
So just to kind of make sure you
understand, so if we start

146
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:23,050
with DNA, and we're essentially
making copies of

147
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,079
DNA, this is replication.

148
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,043
You're replicating the DNA.

149
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:39,026
Now, if you're starting with DNA
and you are creating mRNA

150
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,000
from the DNA template, this
is transcription.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,005


152
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:51,016
You are transcribing the
information from one form to

153
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:53,082
another: transcription.

154
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:57,051
Now, when the mRNA leaves the
nucleus of the cell, and I've

155
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:00,019
talked-- well, let me just draw
a cell just to hit the

156
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,010
point home, if this is a whole
cell, and we'll do the

157
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,008
structure of a cell
in the future.

158
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,087
If that's the whole cell, the
nucleus is the center.

159
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:10,037
That's where all the DNA is
sitting in there, and all of

160
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:13,050
the replication and the
transcription occurs in here,

161
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,031
but then the mRNA leaves the
cell, and then inside the

162
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,026
ribosomes, which we'll talk
about more in the future, you

163
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:22,047
have translation occur and
the proteins get formed.

164
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:29,043
So mRNA to protein
is translation.

165
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:33,023
You're translating from the
genetic code, so to speak, to

166
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,080
the protein code.

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,005
So this is translation.

168
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:38,033


169
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:43,002
So these are just good words to
make sure you get clear and

170
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,028
make sure you're using the right
word when you're talking

171
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:46,065
about the different processes.

172
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:51,055
Now, the other part of the
vocabulary of DNA, which, when

173
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:54,025
I first learned it, I found
tremendously confusing, are

174
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,060
the words chromosome.

175
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,012
I'll write them down here
because you can already

176
00:08:58,012 --> 00:09:04,010
appreciate how confusing
they are: chromosome,

177
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,059
chromatin and chromatid.

178
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:14,012


179
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,021
So a chromosome, we already
talked about.

180
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,075
You can have DNA.

181
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,087
You can have a strand of DNA.

182
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:23,052
That's a double helix.

183
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:27,047
This strand, if I were to zoom
in, is actually two different

184
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:29,090
helices, and, of course,
they have their base

185
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,013
pairs joined up.

186
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:35,073
I'll just draw some base pairs
joined up like that.

187
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,047
So I want to be clear, when I
draw this little green line

188
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,062
here, it's actually
a double helix.

189
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:45,034
Now, that double helix gets
wrapped around proteins that

190
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,059
are called histones.

191
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:51,028


192
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,065
So let's say it gets wrapped
like there, and it gets

193
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:56,000
wrapped around like that, and
it gets wrapped around like

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,048
that, and you have here these
things called histones, which

195
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,073
are these proteins.

196
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:04,089


197
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:12,088
Now, this structure, when you
talk about the DNA in

198
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:16,003
combination with the proteins
that kind of give it structure

199
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:18,005
and then these proteins are
actually wrapped around more

200
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:20,067
and more, and eventually,
depending on what stage we are

201
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,065
in the cell's life, you have
different structures.

202
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:26,044
But when you talk about the
nucleic acid, which is the

203
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:29,041
DNA, and you combine that with
the proteins, you're talking

204
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,066
about the chromatin.

205
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,098


206
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:39,010
So this is DNA plus-- you can
view it as structural proteins

207
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,016
that give the DNA its shape.

208
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,010


209
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,063
And the idea, chromatin was
first used-- because when

210
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,046
people look at a cell, every
time I've drawn these cell

211
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:54,062
nucleuses so far, I've drawn
these very well defined-- I'll

212
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,014
use the word.

213
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:57,012
So let's say this is
a cell's nucleus.

214
00:10:57,012 --> 00:11:01,005
I've been drawing very
well-defined structures here.

215
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,084
So that's one, and then this
could be another one, maybe

216
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:07,041
it's shorter, and then it has
its homologous chromosome.

217
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,040
So I've been drawing these
chromosomes, right?

218
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,078
And each of these chromosomes
I did in the last video are

219
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,026
essentially these long
structures of DNA, long chains

220
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:21,000
of DNA kind of wrapped tightly
around each other.

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,078
So when I drew it like that, if
we zoomed in, you'd see one

222
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:25,083
strand and it's really
just wrapped

223
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,067
around itself like this.

224
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:32,016
And then its homologous
chromosome-- and remember, in

225
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:34,050
the variation video, I talked
about the homologous

226
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,096
chromosome that essentially
codes for the same genes but

227
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,041
has a different version.

228
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,063
If the blue came from the dad,
the red came from the mom, but

229
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:46,012
it's coding for essentially
the same genes.

230
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:52,036
So when we talk about this one
chain, let's say this one

231
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:57,028
chain that I got from my dad of
DNA in this structure, we

232
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:58,065
refer to that as a chromosome.

233
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:01,067


234
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:05,039
Now, if we refer generally-- and
I want to be clear here.

235
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,095
DNA only takes this shape at
certain stages of its life

236
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:14,089
when it's actually replicating
itself-- not when it's

237
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,050
replicating.

238
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,094
Before the cell can divide,
DNA takes this very

239
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:21,042
well-defined shape.

240
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:24,024
Most of the cell's life, when
the DNA is actually doing its

241
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:26,070
work, when it's actually
creating proteins or proteins

242
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,008
are being essentially
transcribed and translated

243
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,037
from the DNA, the DNA isn't
all bundled up like this.

244
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,062
Because if it was bundled up
like, it would be very hard

245
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:42,030
for the replication and the
transcription machinery to get

246
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,071
onto the DNA and make the
proteins and do whatever else.

247
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:48,061
Normally, DNA-- let me draw
that same nucleus.

248
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:53,077
Normally, you can't even see
it with a normal light

249
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,024
microscope.

250
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,069
It's so thin that the DNA strand
is just completely

251
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,098
separated around the cell.

252
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:02,015
I'm drawing it here so you can
try to-- maybe the other one

253
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,055
is like this, right?

254
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:08,087
And then you have that shorter
strand that's like this.

255
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,055
And so you can't even see it.

256
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,050
It's not in this well-defined
structure.

257
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,039
This is the way it
normally is.

258
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,065
And they have the other short
strand that's like that.

259
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:21,054
So you would just see this
kind of big mess of a

260
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:24,075
combination of DNA and proteins,
and this is what

261
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:26,040
people essentially refer
to as chromatin.

262
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,095


263
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,053
So the words can be very
ambiguous and very confusing,

264
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:34,098
but the general usage is when
you're talking about the

265
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:39,058
well-defined one chain of DNA
in this kind of well-defined

266
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:42,025
structure, that is
a chromosome.

267
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:46,076
Chromatin can either refer to
kind of the structure of the

268
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:50,073
chromosome, the combination of
the DNA and the proteins that

269
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:54,045
give the structure, or it can
refer to this whole mess of

270
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:59,052
multiple chromosomes of which
you have all of this DNA from

271
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:01,010
multiple chromosomes
and all the

272
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,024
proteins all jumbled together.

273
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,051
So I just want to
make that clear.

274
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,099
Now, then the next word
is, well, what is

275
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:08,028
this chromatid thing?

276
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:10,030
What is this chromatid thing?

277
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,004
Actually, just in case I didn't,
I don't remember if I

278
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:12,054
labeled these.

279
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:16,021
These proteins that give
structure to the chromatin or

280
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,088
that make up the chromatin or
that give structure to the

281
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:23,053
chromosome, they're
called histones.

282
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,044
And there are multiple types
that give structure at

283
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,030
different levels, and we'll
do that in more detail.

284
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,085
So what's a chromatid?

285
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:34,077
When DNA replicates-- so
let's say that was

286
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:37,078
my DNA before, right?

287
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,039
When it's just in its normal
state, I have one version from

288
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,062
my dad, one version
from my mom.

289
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:44,026
Now, let's say it replicates.

290
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:48,067
So my version from my dad,
at first it's like this.

291
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,024
It's a big strand of DNA.

292
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:53,055
It creates another version of
itself that is identical, if

293
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:57,085
the machinery worked properly,
and so that identical piece

294
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,059
will look like this.

295
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,047
And they actually are initially

296
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,014
attached to each other.

297
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:05,000
They're attached to each other
at a point called the

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,025
centromere.

299
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,075


300
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,085
Now, even though I
have two strands

301
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,030
here, they're now attached.

302
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,086
When I have these two strands
that contain the exact-- so I

303
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:20,041
have this strand right here, and
then I have-- well, let me

304
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,017
actually draw it a
different way.

305
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,009
I could draw it multiple
different ways.

306
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,024
I could say this is one strand
here and then I have another

307
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:32,000
strand here.

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,017
Now, I have two copies.

309
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,012
They're coding for the
exact same DNA.

310
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,033
They're identical.

311
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,000
I still call this
a chromosome.

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,075


313
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:48,047
This whole thing is still called
a chromosome, but now

314
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,039
each individual copy is
called a chromatid.

315
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:57,065
So that's one chromatid and
this is another chromatid.

316
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,095
Sometimes they'll call them
sister chromatids.

317
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:01,074
Maybe they should call them twin
chromatids because they

318
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:05,058
have the same genetic
information.

319
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:08,049
So this chromosome has
two chromatids.

320
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:12,075
Now, before the replication
occurred or the DNA duplicated

321
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:16,053
itself, you could say that this
chromosome right here,

322
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,057
this chromosome like a father,
has one chromatid.

323
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:20,074
You could call it a chromatid,
although that tends to not be

324
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:21,061
the convention.

325
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:25,010
People start talking about
chromatids once you have two

326
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,077
of them in a chromosome.

327
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:29,075
And we'll learn in mitosis and
meiosis, these two chromatids

328
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:34,071
separate, and once they
separate, that same strand of

329
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:38,057
DNA that you once called a
chromatid, you now call them

330
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:40,037
individually chromosomes.

331
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:43,060
So that's one of them, and then
you have another one that

332
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,037
maybe gets separated
in this direction.

333
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,071
Let me circle that one
with the green.

334
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:51,019
So this one might move away like
that, and the one that I

335
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,050
circled in the orange might
move away like this.

336
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,082
Now, once they separate and
they're no longer connected by

337
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:59,028
the centromere, now what we
originally called as one

338
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:02,066
chromosome with two chromatids,
you will now refer

339
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,081
to as two separate
chromosomes.

340
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:07,095
Or you could say now you have
two separate chromosomes, each

341
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,078
made up of one chromatid.

342
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,052
So hopefully, that clears up a
little bit some of this jargon

343
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:14,024
around DNA.

344
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:16,013
I always found it
quite confusing.

345
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,035
But it'll be a useful tool
when we start going into

346
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:20,026
mitosis and meiosis, and
I start saying, oh, the

347
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:21,036
chromosomes become chromatids.

348
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:23,097
And you'll say, like, wait, how
did one chromosome become

349
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:24,085
two chromosomes?

350
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,027
And how did a chromatid
become a chromosome?

351
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,047
And it all just revolves
around the vocabulary.

352
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,073
I would have picked different
vocabulary than calling this a

353
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,073
chromosome and calling each
of these individually

354
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:36,088
chromosomes, but that's
the way we have

355
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,092
decided to name them.

356
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:39,051
Actually, just in case you're
curious, you're probably

357
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,075
thinking, where does this
word chromo come?

358
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:43,050
I don't know if you know
old Kodak film was

359
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,054
called chromo color.

360
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:47,046
And chromo essentially
relates to color.

361
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,091
I think it comes from the Greek
word actually for color.

362
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:52,082
It got that word because when
people first started looking

363
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:56,000
in the nucleus of a cell, they
would apply dye, and these

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,048
things that we call chromosomes
would take up the

365
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:02,001
dye so that we could see it well
with a light microscope.

366
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:04,053
And some comes from soma for
body, so you could kind of

367
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,055
view it as colored body,
so that's why

368
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:07,076
they call it a chromsome.

369
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:12,092
So chromatin also will take up--
well, I won't go into all

370
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,052
of that as well.

371
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:15,007
But hopefully, that clears
a little bit this whole

372
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:19,048
chromatid, chromosome, chromatin
debate, and we're

373
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,078
well equipped now to study
mitosis and meiosis.

374
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:23,003

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,054
I thought I would make a quick
video to clarify some points

3
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:06,061
on evolution and maybe clear up
some points of ambiguity in

4
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:08,000
some of my previous videos.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,073
So when you go to the natural
history museum and you see

6
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:12,039
these drawings where they start
with a primitive ape and

7
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,097
they show progressive species
that show some form of

8
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:18,042
progress, at least some form of
progress when it comes to

9
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:23,050
walking on two feet, it
culminates with Homo Sapiens--

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,094
us-- you imagine that evolution
is kind of this

11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,057
process that creates better
and better things.

12
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:34,004
You imagine that there's this
notion of progress that, as

13
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:38,096
time goes on, each successive
species is better than its

14
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,088
first.

15
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:43,024
And I want to be very clear
that this notion of better

16
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:46,038
really makes no sense in an
evolutionary or natural

17
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,000
selection context.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,034
That all that matters is fitness
to your environment or

19
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,090
the frequency with which you're
able to reproduce in an

20
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,003
environment, which doesn't
really match to

21
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,084
our notion of better.

22
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,078
So some people kind of think of,
well, what's going to be

23
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:06,020
the next step in human
evolution?

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,089
And they imagine some human with
a big brain that can move

25
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:16,035
things with mental energy and
all of that and can see

26
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,068
through things or
whatever else.

27
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:19,065
They imagine some kind of
progress, that, look, we're

28
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,043
more intelligent.

29
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:23,062
We can do all of these things
that an ape couldn't do.

30
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:27,015
Maybe the next stage in
evolution somehow will be some

31
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,062
type of superhuman.

32
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:31,009
And I don't know what the next
stage of evolution, if there

33
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,015
is any next stage for-- I can't
go into that debate, but

34
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:37,037
the idea is that that's not
necessarily the case.

35
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:42,095
Even if you take our current
human population, success in

36
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:47,034
evolutionary terms is very
different than success in our

37
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,020
kind of societal definition.

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,062
For example, let's say that
you have two people.

39
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:59,089
You know, this guy, some dude
here, he's got a Ph.D, he's

40
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:05,012
got an MD, he's got a lot of
money, I mean, just everything

41
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,092
that society says is a success,
but because he did

42
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:10,000
his MD, Ph.D, he's been in
school a long time, and he

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,078
decides not to have children,
or if he wants to be very

44
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,093
responsible, he looks at how
many people there are in the

45
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,065
world and the overcrowding and
the environmental impact.

46
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:21,000
So let's say him and his wife,
who is also an MD, Ph.D, and

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,075
has all this money and degrees
and have spent a lot of their

48
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:28,080
time in school, they decide
to have one child.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,075
Let me see, this is his wife,
who has kind of similarly--

50
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:34,046
she's similarly educated, and
from our point of view is a

51
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:37,025
very successful, very
responsible couple.

52
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:41,093
Now let's say that there's some
other guy over here, and

53
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:44,075
he's just kind of-- for the
sake of it, let's say he's

54
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:49,005
just nuts, that from the
get-go he was very

55
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,015
irresponsible.

56
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:54,025
He produced one child
after another.

57
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:58,075
Let's say by the time he's 30
years old, he has 10 children,

58
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:01,059
all with different mothers,
maybe some of the children had

59
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:03,015
to go up for adoption.

60
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,063
Who knows the situation
with this guy's life?

61
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:08,090
I don't want to be judgmental of
it, but the general idea is

62
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,003
that in society, we would say,
oh, this guy is less

63
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,008
successful.

64
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:16,087
But from an evolutionary point
of view, this guy was far more

65
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,077
successful.

66
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:21,038
In fact, people like this guy,
the frequency of their genes

67
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:24,062
is increasing much faster than
the frequency of these

68
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:25,093
people's genes.

69
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:28,084
So when we talk about fitness
from an evolutionary point of

70
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:31,081
view, it's not necessarily
fitness from the point of view

71
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:35,059
that we like to think of it in
our regular kind of value

72
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,011
system that we have
in society.

73
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,019
These people looked very fit,
intellectually and, who knows,

74
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,072
maybe physically as well, but
they weren't reproducing.

75
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,013
Their genes aren't being passed
on with the frequency

76
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,012
of these guys.

77
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:51,016
I forgot the statistic, but
there's something like 80% of

78
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:56,078
people in Asia have genes from
either one man or some small

79
00:03:56,078 --> 00:04:00,015
collection of men who date--
actually, I think it's from

80
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:02,018
one man-- from the 1200s.

81
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,081
And it's either probably one
of the Mongol warriors,

82
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,052
whether it's Genghis or Kublai
Khan, but it just shows you

83
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:11,041
that there are some very-- and
I'm not going to make any

84
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,022
judgments here, but you could
have very kind of aggressive

85
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:17,089
people who may have raped and
pillaged whole societies, and

86
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,025
they were very successful from
an evolutionary point of view,

87
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:22,087
even though we might think
that their actions are

88
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,079
despicable.

89
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,047
So I want to give you the
sense that there's not

90
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,067
necessarily the sense
of progress.

91
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:31,043
If this pattern I described
keeps happening, then this

92
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:35,062
type of person will become less
and less frequent in the

93
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:38,014
gene pool and this person will
become more and more frequent

94
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:39,000
in the gene pool.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,016
So we might end up with
eventually a more aggressive

96
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:46,022
human population or a less
quote-unquote responsible one.

97
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:50,063
So I want to make that one
clarification that evolution,

98
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:54,074
or natural selection, is not
just a series of progressive

99
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:58,005
steps where we'll slowly and
slowly become-- or any

100
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:01,074
organism becomes kind of a
better and more intelligent

101
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:02,073
and faster animal.

102
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,088
It just depends on its
environment and what it's

103
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,045
being selected for.

104
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,041
Now the other thing I want to
clarify is, really, some of

105
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:14,012
the points I made on the video
regarding intelligent design.

106
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:17,036
In that video, my intention
was not to really make a

107
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:20,069
comparison between intelligent
design and evolution.

108
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,036
So you have evolution on this
side and you have intelligent

109
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:25,072
design on this side.

110
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:27,082
And I want to be clear, and I
didn't maybe make it clear

111
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,087
enough in that video,
that this debate is

112
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:31,017
an artificial one.

113
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:34,080
Evolution really is the basis
of modern biology.

114
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:43,060
If you want to understand how
the flu works, or if you

115
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,051
wanted to understand the human
genome, or if you wanted to

116
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:50,052
understand heredity, evolution
is the cornerstone of that.

117
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,092
And it's not complete.

118
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:54,049
Every day, every year, we're
discovering more and more

119
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,006
about how the process of natural
selection works.

120
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,044
There are still open debates.

121
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:02,045
People aren't sure the pace at
which evolution occurs, other

122
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:06,041
factors that might make it occur
faster or slower, but I

123
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,087
want to be clear.

124
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:10,051
This does explain all
of our observations.

125
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:13,018
Or let me put it this way: All
of our observations in modern

126
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:15,018
science are backing up

127
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:16,070
evolution and natural selection.

128
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,099
And if anything, it is the
basis of modern biology.

129
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:24,042
So if one were to deny natural
selection and evolution,

130
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,000
they're really denying our

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,058
understanding of modern biology.

132
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:32,038
Intelligent design is a belief
system, and my whole point

133
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,054
behind making that is to try to
maybe reconcile the parties

134
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:42,048
that favor this with the idea
of evolution, so that they

135
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:46,083
could reconcile one's religious
beliefs while not

136
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,054
having to deny what is the
cornerstone of modern biology.

137
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:53,048
And when I talk about design,
I make the point that, look,

138
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:55,068
you know, rather than looking
at the particular design,

139
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:58,033
whether it's the eye or a
particular organism, and I

140
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,032
even make the point that there
is no particular design.

141
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:03,085
Even if you were to point to the
human eye, there's not one

142
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:04,087
version of the human eye.

143
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:08,013
There's an infinite variation in
the human eye, so it would

144
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,001
even have to be intelligent
designs,

145
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,052
not intelligent design.

146
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:16,004
But my whole point behind the
video was to say if you are

147
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:20,024
inclined to believe in a
designer, then the more

148
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,012
elegant design is at
the system level,

149
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:24,018
which really is evolution.

150
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:26,060
Now, I wasn't trying to say
there is a designer or there

151
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,050
isn't a designer.

152
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,017
I was just saying if you are
inclined to believe in one,

153
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,085
this is more profound and gives
more justice to the

154
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:38,061
designer that you are inclined
to believe in.

155
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,075
This is not science at all.

156
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:45,089
Intelligent design is a denial
of what all of modern science

157
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,016
is telling us today.

158
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:52,002
And it's not a theory, as some
proponents of it put it, and

159
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:55,075
they kind of surround it with
scientific-sounding terms, but

160
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,055
it's not a theory.

161
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,067
You cannot test intelligent
design.

162
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:02,041
There's no data point that will
confirm or deny whether

163
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,054
somehow something was
designed by some

164
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,057
type of sentient creator.

165
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:09,094
This is just a belief
system that is

166
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:11,024
essentially rejecting this.

167
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,019
But I don't want to be
disrespectful of those who

168
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,045
believe in this belief system,
because it comes out of

169
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,083
closely held beliefs.

170
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,072
My goal really is to
reconcile that.

171
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:30,051
And if you do want to give your
belief in a creator due

172
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,087
credit, you're better looking
at the system

173
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,070
rather than the design.

174
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,011
So I just wanted to make
those two points, two

175
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:35,085
clarifications.

176
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:38,038
One on the evolution/intelligent
design--

177
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,086
quote-unquote-- debate.

178
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,000
But it's not really a debate.

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,082
This is kind of the cornerstone
of modern biology.

180
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:46,021
This is something that
just rejects that.

181
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,071
It isn't a provable or
disprovable theory.

182
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,063
And I wanted to make the point
that evolution doesn't

183
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:54,035
necessarily mean a
straightforward line of

184
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:57,025
progress in evermore
intelligent

185
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,088
and impressive creatures.

186
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,053

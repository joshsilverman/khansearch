1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,038


2
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:02,048
In the last video we learned
a little bit about

3
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,012
photosynthesis.

4
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:06,079
And we know in very general
terms, it's the process where

5
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:12,058
we start off with photons and
water and carbon dioxide, and

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,021
we use that energy in the
photons to fix the carbon.

7
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,067
And now, this idea of carbon
fixation is essentially taking

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:24,039
carbon in the gaseous form, in
this case carbon dioxide, and

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,053
fixing it into a solid
structure.

10
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:30,019
And that solid structure we fix
it into is a carbohydrate.

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,039
The first end-product of
photosynthesis was this

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,082
3-carbon chain, this
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

13
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:40,088
But then you can use that to
build up glucose or any other

14
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:42,003
carbohydrate.

15
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,063
So, with that said, let's try to
dig a little bit deeper and

16
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:48,071
understand what's actually going
on in these stages of

17
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,042
photosynthesis.

18
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,092
Remember, we said there's
two stages.

19
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:54,002
The light-dependent reactions
and then you have the light

20
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,015
independent reactions.

21
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,036
I don't like using the word
dark reaction because it

22
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:59,060
actually occurs while
the sun is outside.

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,010
It's actually occurring
simultaneously

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,029
with the light reactions.

25
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,015
It just doesn't need the
photons from the sun.

26
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,026
But let's focus first on the
light-dependent reactions.

27
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,065
The part that actually uses
photons from the sun.

28
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:16,090
Or actually, I guess, even
photons from the heat lamp

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,009
that you might have in
your greenhouse.

30
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:23,050
And uses those photons in
conjunction with water to

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:35,035
produce ATP and reduce
NADP plus to NADPH.

32
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:40,006
Remember, reduction is gaining
electrons or hydrogen atoms.

33
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,003
And it's the same thing,
because when you gain a

34
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:45,026
hydrogen atom, including its
electron, since hydrogen is

35
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:48,017
not too electronegative, you
get to hog its electron.

36
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:51,081
So this is both gaining a
hydrogen and gaining electron.

37
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,079
But let's study it a
little bit more.

38
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,065
So before we dig a little
deeper, I think it's good to

39
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:59,075
know a little bit about the
anatomy of a plant.

40
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:03,051
So let me draw some
plant cells.

41
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:06,053
So plant cells actually have
cell walls, so I can draw them

42
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:08,031
a little bit rigid.

43
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:11,083
So let's say that these are
plant cells right here.

44
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:15,028
Each of these squares, each of
these quadrilaterals is a

45
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,028
plant cell.

46
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,088
And then in these plant cells
you have these organelles

47
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:20,087
called chloroplasts.

48
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:22,097
Remember organelles are
like organs of a cell.

49
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,022
They are subunits,

50
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:27,000
membrane-bound subunits of cells.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,030
And of course, these cells have
nucleuses and DNA and all

52
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,043
of the other things you normally
associate with cells.

53
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,043
But I'm not going to
draw them here.

54
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm just going to draw
the chloroplasts.

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,096
And your average plant cell--
and there are other types of

56
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:43,068
living organisms that perform
photosynthesis, but we'll

57
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:44,059
focus on plants.

58
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:47,094
Because that's what we tend
to associate it with.

59
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:53,053
Each plant cell will contain
10 to 50 chloroplasts.

60
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,037
I make them green on purpose
because the chloroplasts

61
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,069
contain chlorophyll.

62
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,056
Which to our eyes,
appear green.

63
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,072
But remember, they're green
because they reflect green

64
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:05,009
light and they absorb red
and blue and other

65
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,003
wavelengths of light.

66
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:06,086
That's why it looks green.

67
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,059
Because it's reflecting.

68
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:09,047
But it's absorbing all the
other wavelengths.

69
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,059
But anyway, we'll talk more
about that in detail.

70
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:16,009
But you'll have 10 to 50 of
these chloroplasts right here.

71
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,093
And then let's zoom in on one
chloroplast. So if we zoom in

72
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:23,031
on one chloroplast. So
let me be very clear.

73
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:26,033
This thing right here
is a plant cell.

74
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,087
That is a plant cell.

75
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:32,041
And then each of these green
things right here is an

76
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:38,053
organelle called the
chloroplast. And let's zoom in

77
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,099
on the chloroplast itself.

78
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,019
If we zoom in on one
chloroplast, it has a

79
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,058
membrane like that.

80
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:52,084


81
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:57,016
And then the fluid inside of the
chloroplast, inside of its

82
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:59,061
membrane, so this fluid
right here.

83
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,036
All of this fluid.

84
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,043
That's called the stroma.

85
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:06,000
The stroma of the chloroplast.
And then within the

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,052
chloroplast itself, you have
these little stacks of these

87
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:13,053
folded membranes, These
little folded stacks.

88
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,045
Let me see if I can
do justice here.

89
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:22,050
So maybe that's one, two,
doing these stacks.

90
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,006
Each of these membrane-bound--
you can almost view them as

91
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,056
pancakes-- let me draw
a couple more.

92
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:31,097
Maybe we have some over here,
just so you-- maybe you have

93
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:35,064
some over here, maybe
some over here.

94
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:38,079
So each of these flattish
looking pancakes right here,

95
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,022
these are called thylakoids.

96
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:43,031
So this right here
is a thylakoid.

97
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,056
That is a thylakoid.

98
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:48,000


99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,008
The thylakoid has a membrane.

100
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,066
And this membrane is especially
important.

101
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,045
We're going to zoom in
on that in a second.

102
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:57,054
So it has a membrane, I'll color
that in a little bit.

103
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:01,072
The inside of the thylakoid, so
the space, the fluid inside

104
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:04,062
of the thylakoid, right
there that area.

105
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:06,022
This light green color
right there.

106
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:10,036
That's called the thylakoid
space or the thylakoid lumen.

107
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,095


108
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:16,052
And just to get all of our
terminology out of the way, a

109
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:22,008
stack of several thylakoids
just like that,

110
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,062
that is called a grana.

111
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:27,001
That's a stack of thylakoids.

112
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:29,083
That is a grana.

113
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,018
And this is an organelle.

114
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:35,017
And evolutionary biologists,
they believe that organelles

115
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:38,025
were once independent
organisms that then,

116
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:41,008
essentially, teamed up with
other organisms and started

117
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,035
living inside of their cells.

118
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,044
So there's actually, they
have their own DNA.

119
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,045
So mitochondria is another
example of an organelle that

120
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:51,048
people believe that one time
mitochondria, or the ancestors

121
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:53,095
of mitochondria, were
independent organisms. That

122
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:56,031
then teamed up with other cells
and said, hey, if I

123
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:58,023
produce your energy maybe
you'll give me

124
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,050
some food or whatnot.

125
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,014
And so they started
evolving together.

126
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:03,074
And they turned into
one organism.

127
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:06,045
Which makes you wonder what we
might evolve-- well anyway,

128
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:07,032
that's a separate thing.

129
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,050
So there's actually ribosomes
out here.

130
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,044
That's good to think about.

131
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:16,027
Just realize that at one point
in the evolutionary past, this

132
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,050
organelle's ancestor
might have been

133
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,037
an independent organism.

134
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:22,068
But anyway, enough about
that speculation.

135
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:29,075
Let's zoom in again on one of
these thylakoid membranes.

136
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:31,000
So I'm going to zoom in.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,025
Let me make a box.

138
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,056


139
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:37,006
Let me zoom in right there.

140
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,099
So that's going to be
my zoom-in box.

141
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,076
So let me make it really big.

142
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,033
Just like this.

143
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,056
So this is my zoom-in box.

144
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:49,018
So that little box is the same
thing as this whole box.

145
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:53,018
So we're zoomed in on the
thylakoid membrane.

146
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:57,050
So this is the thylakoid
membrane right there.

147
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,081
That's actually a phospho-bilipd
layer.

148
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:04,001
It has your hydrophilic,
hydrophobic tails.

149
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,066
I mean, I could draw it
like that if you like.

150
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:07,081
The important thing from the
photosynthesis point of view

151
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,055
is that it's this membrane.

152
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,029
And on the outside of the
membrane, right here on the

153
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:16,093
outside, you have the fluid
that fills up the entire

154
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,054
chloroplast. So here you
have the stroma.

155
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:23,020
And then this space right here,
this is the inside of

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,062
your thylakoid.

157
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:25,077
So this is the lumen.

158
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,087
So if I were to color it
pink, right there.

159
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,001
This is your lumen.

160
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,077
Your thylakoid space.

161
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:33,038
And in this membrane, and this
might look a little bit

162
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,018
familiar if you think about
mitochondria and the electron

163
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:37,004
transport chain.

164
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:39,093
What I'm going to describe in
this video actually is an

165
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,076
electron transport chain.

166
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:44,025
Many people might not consider
it the electron transport

167
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,061
chain, but it's the same idea.

168
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:48,066
Same general idea.

169
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,027
So on this membrane you have
these proteins and these

170
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:53,023
complexes of proteins
and molecules

171
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,047
that span this membrane.

172
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:58,013
So let me draw a
couple of them.

173
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:01,059
So maybe I'll call this
one, photosystem II.

174
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,050
And I'm calling it that because
that's what it is.

175
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,081
Photosystem II.

176
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,031
You have maybe another
complex.

177
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,056
And these are hugely
complicated.

178
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:11,004
I'll do a sneak peek of
what photosystem II

179
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,067
actually looks like.

180
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:15,018
This is actually what
photosystem II looks like.

181
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,088
So, as you can see, it
truly is a complex.

182
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:20,045
These cylindrical things,
these are proteins.

183
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:23,057
These green things are
chlorophyll molecules.

184
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,001
I mean, there's all sorts
of things going here.

185
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,008
And they're all jumbled
together.

186
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,030
I think a complex probably
is the best word.

187
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,032
It's a bunch of proteins, a
bunch of molecules just

188
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:35,046
jumbled together to perform a
very particular function.

189
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:38,044
We're going to describe
that in a few seconds.

190
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,058
So that's what photosystem
II looks like.

191
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:43,085
Then you also have
photosystem I.

192
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:47,050
And then you have other
molecules, other complexes.

193
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,012
You have the cytochrome B6F
complex and I'll draw this in

194
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:55,012
a different color right here.

195
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,034
I don't want to get too
much into the weeds.

196
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,002
Because the most important thing
is just to understand.

197
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:02,078
So you have other protein
complexes, protein molecular

198
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,014
complexes here that also
span the membrane.

199
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,084
But the general idea-- I'll tell
you the general idea and

200
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:11,085
then we'll go into the
specifics-- of what happens

201
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:23,036
during the light reaction, or
the light dependent reaction,

202
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,095
is you have some photons.

203
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:27,014
Photons from the sun.

204
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:29,047
They've traveled 93
million miles.

205
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:34,032
so you have some photons that
go here and they excite

206
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,095
electrons in a chlorophyll
molecule, in a

207
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:39,076
chlorophyll A molecule.

208
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:42,091
And actually in photosystem II--
well, I won't go into the

209
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,072
details just yet-- but they
excite a chlorophyll molecule

210
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:49,005
so those electrons enter into
a high energy state.

211
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,015
Maybe I shouldn't draw
it like that.

212
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,069
They enter into a high
energy state.

213
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:56,008
And then as they go from
molecule to molecule they keep

214
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:57,075
going down in energy state.

215
00:09:57,075 --> 00:10:01,077
But as they go down in energy
state, you have hydrogen

216
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:04,047
atoms, or actually I should say
hydrogen protons without

217
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:05,007
the electrons.

218
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:08,037
So you have all of these
hydrogen protons.

219
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:12,058
Hydrogen protons get pumped
into the lumen.

220
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:15,073
They get pumped into the lumen
and so you might remember this

221
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,021
from the electron
transport chain.

222
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:19,057
In the electron transport chain,
as electrons went from

223
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:24,015
a high potential, a high energy
state, to a low energy

224
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:27,011
state, that energy
was used to pump

225
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,024
hydrogens through a membrane.

226
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:33,028
And in that case it was in the
mitochondria, here the

227
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:35,075
membrane is the thylakoid
membrane.

228
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:39,075
But either case, you're creating
this gradient where--

229
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:43,064
because of the energy from,
essentially the photons-- the

230
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,033
electrons enter a high energy
state, they keep going into a

231
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,037
lower energy state.

232
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,087
And then they actually go to
photosystem I and they get hit

233
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,090
by another photon.

234
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,063
Well, that's a simplification,
but that's how you

235
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:53,019
can think of it.

236
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,035
Enter another high energy
state, then they go to a

237
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:56,090
lower, lower and lower
energy state.

238
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,053
But the whole time, that energy
from the electrons

239
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,075
going from a high energy state
to a low energy state is used

240
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:07,012
to pump hydrogen protons
into the lumen.

241
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:08,039
So you have this huge

242
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,044
concentration of hydrogen protons.

243
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:17,067
And just like what we saw in the
electron transport chain,

244
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:21,098
that concentration is then-- of
hydrogen protons-- is then

245
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,097
used to drive ATP synthase.

246
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:28,032
So the exact same-- let me see
if I can draw that ATP

247
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:29,030
synthase here.

248
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,087
You might remember ATP
synthase looks

249
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:33,015
something like this.

250
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:36,050
Where literally, so here you
have a huge concentration of

251
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,085
hydrogen protons.

252
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:41,000
So they'll want to
go back into the

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,023
stroma from the lumen.

254
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:42,089
And they do.

255
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,066
And they go through
the ATP synthase.

256
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,020
Let me do it in a new color.

257
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,082
So these hydrogen protons are
going to make their way back.

258
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,021
Go back down the gradient.

259
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,089
And as they go down the
gradient, they literally--

260
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,071
it's like an engine.

261
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:59,071
And I go into detail on this
when I talk about respiration.

262
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:04,001
And that turns, literally
mechanically turns, this top

263
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,085
part-- the way I drew it--
of the ATP synthase.

264
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:11,075
And it puts ADP and phosphate
groups together.

265
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:15,055
It puts ADP plus phosphate
groups

266
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:20,025
together to produce ATP.

267
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:22,074
So that's the general,
very high overview.

268
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,011
And I'm going to go into more
detail in a second.

269
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:29,050
But this process that I just
described is called

270
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,020
photophosphorylation.

271
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,045
Let me do it in a nice color.

272
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:40,044


273
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:41,085
Why is it called that?

274
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:43,038
Well, because we're
using photons.

275
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,046
That's the photo part.

276
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,026
We're using light.

277
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:49,019
We're using photons to excite
electrons in chlorophyll.

278
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,042
As those electrons get passed
from one molecule, from one

279
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:55,096
electron acceptor to another,
they enter into lower and

280
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:57,048
lower energy states.

281
00:12:57,048 --> 00:13:01,016
As they go into lower energy
states, that's used to drive,

282
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:05,026
literally, pumps that allow
hydrogen protons to go from

283
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,024
the stroma to the lumen.

284
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,089
Then the hydrogen protons
want to go back.

285
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,010
They want to-- I guess you could
call it-- chemiosmosis.

286
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,076
They want to go back into the
stroma and then that drives

287
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:19,017
ATP synthase.

288
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,094
Right here, this is
ATP synthase.

289
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:26,026
ATP synthase to essentially
jam together ADPs and

290
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:29,080
phosphate groups
to produce ATP.

291
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,045
Now, when I originally talked
about the light reactions and

292
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:37,000
dark reactions I said, well the
light reactions have two

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,004
byproducts.

294
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:42,076
It has ATP and it also has--
actually it has three.

295
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:46,062
It has ATP, and it
also has NADPH.

296
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:49,034
NADP is reduced.

297
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:51,079
It gains these electrons
and these hydrogens.

298
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,005
So where does that show up?

299
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:56,066
Well, if we're talking about
non-cyclic oxidative

300
00:13:56,066 --> 00:14:00,029
photophosphorylation, or
non-cyclic light reactions,

301
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,096
the final electron acceptor.

302
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:05,033
So after that electron keeps
entering lower and lower

303
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,044
energy states, the
final electron

304
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:12,009
acceptor is NADP plus.

305
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,034
So once it accepts the electrons
and a hydrogen

306
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:17,045
proton with it, it
becomes NADPH.

307
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:20,048


308
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:25,059
Now, I also said that part of
this process, water-- and this

309
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:30,000
is actually a very interesting
thing-- water gets oxidized to

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,026
molecular oxygen.

311
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,098
So where does that happen?

312
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:37,005
So when I said, up here in
photosystem I, that we have a

313
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:43,022
chlorophyll molecule that has
an electron excited, and it

314
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,050
goes into a higher
energy state.

315
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,040
And then that electron
essentially gets passed from

316
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,047
one guy to the next, that begs
the question, what can we use

317
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,054
to replace that electron?

318
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:56,034
And it turns out that we use,
we literally use, the

319
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,069
electrons in water.

320
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:03,087
So over here you literally
have H2O.

321
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:08,000
And H2O donates the hydrogens
and the electrons with it.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,086
So you can kind of imagine it
donates two hydrogen protons

323
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:14,092
and two electrons to replace the
electron that got excited

324
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,086
by the photons.

325
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,077
Because that electron got passed
all the way over to

326
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:21,000
photosystem I and eventually
ends up in NADPH.

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,062
So, you're literally stripping
electrons off of water.

328
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,064
And when you strip off the
electrons and the hydrogens,

329
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:30,047
you're just left with
molecular oxygen.

330
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,029
Now, the reason why I want to
really focus on this is that

331
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,097
there's something profound
happening here.

332
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,050
Or at least on a chemistry
level,

333
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,060
something profound is happening.

334
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,050
You're oxidizing water.

335
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,048
And in the entire biological
kingdom, the only place where

336
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:49,028
we know something that is strong
enough of an oxidizing

337
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,039
agent to oxidize water, to
literally take away electrons

338
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,021
from water.

339
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,063
Which means you're
really taking

340
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,067
electrons away from oxygen.

341
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,083
So you're oxidizing oxygen.

342
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,012
The only place that we know
that an oxidation agent is

343
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:06,055
strong enough to do this
is in photosystem II.

344
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:09,055
So it's a very profound idea,
that normally electrons are

345
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,096
very happy in water.

346
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:14,065
They're very happy circulating
around oxygens.

347
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:17,030
Oxygen is a very electronegative
atom.

348
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,083
That's why we even call it
oxidizing, because oxygen is

349
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,023
very good at oxidizing things.

350
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,036
But all of a sudden we've
found something that can

351
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:29,048
oxidize oxygen, that can strip
electrons off of oxygen and

352
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:32,067
then give those electrons
to the chlorophyll.

353
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:35,013
The electron gets excited
by photons.

354
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:36,098
Then those photons enter
lower and lower and

355
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,094
lower energy states.

356
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:40,024
Get excited again in photosystem
I by another set

357
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,087
of photons and then enter lower
and lower and lower

358
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,075
energy states.

359
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:47,050
And then finally,
end up at NADPH.

360
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,013
And the whole time it entered
lower and lower energy states,

361
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:54,016
that energy was being used to
pump hydrogen across this

362
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,035
membrane from the
stroma to lumen.

363
00:16:56,035 --> 00:17:01,025
And then that gradient is used
to actually produce ATP.

364
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,050
So in the next video I'm going
to give a little bit more

365
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,004
context about what this means
in terms of energy states of

366
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:11,003
electrons and what's at a higher
or lower energy state.

367
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:13,020
But this is essentially
all that's happening.

368
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,045
Electrons get excited.

369
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:17,011


370
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,085
Those electrons eventually
end up at NADPH.

371
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:23,065
And as the electron gets excited
and goes into lower

372
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,016
and lower energy states,
it pumps

373
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,028
hydrogen across the gradient.

374
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:30,090
And then that gradient is used
to drive ATP synthase, to

375
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,010
generate ATP.

376
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,026
And then that original electron
that got excited, it

377
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:35,048
had to be replaced.

378
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:39,020
And that replaced electron is
actually stripped off of H2O.

379
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,068
So the hydrogen protons and
the electrons of H2O are

380
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:46,029
stripped away and you're just
left with molecular oxygen.

381
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,006
And just to get a nice
appreciation of the complexity

382
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:51,097
of all of this-- I showed you
this earlier in the video--

383
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:55,025
but this is literally a-- I mean
this isn't a picture of

384
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:56,000
photosystem II.

385
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,082
You actually don't have
cylinders like this.

386
00:17:57,082 --> 00:18:01,010
But these cylinders represent
proteins.

387
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:07,049
Right here, these green kind
of scaffold-like molecules,

388
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,039
that's chlorophyll A.

389
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,039
And what literally happens, is
you have photons hitting--

390
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,053
actually it doesn't always have
to hit chlorophyll A.

391
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:20,028
It can also hit what's called
antenna molecules.

392
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:22,054
So antenna molecules are other
types of chlorophyll, and

393
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,098
actually other types
of molecules.

394
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:31,050
And so a photon, or a set of
photons, comes here and maybe

395
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,044
it excites some electrons,
it doesn't have to be in

396
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:35,086
chlorophyll A.

397
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:38,022
It could be in some of these
other types of chlorophyll.

398
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:41,020
Or in some of these other I
guess you could call them,

399
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,067
pigment molecules that will
absorb these photons.

400
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,050
And then their electrons
get excited.

401
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,069
And you can almost imagine
it as a vibration.

402
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:50,086
But when you're talking about
things on the quantum level,

403
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,023
vibrations really don't
make sense.

404
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:53,041
But it's a good analogy.

405
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,097
They kind of vibrate their
way to chlorophyll A.

406
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:58,053
And this is called
resonance energy.

407
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:04,066


408
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:07,044
They vibrate their way,
eventually, to chlorophyll A.

409
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:11,095
And then in chlorophyll A, you
have the electron get excited.

410
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:15,061
The primary electron acceptor
is actually this molecule

411
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,046
right here.

412
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:17,047
Pheophytin.

413
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,009
Some people call it pheo.

414
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,038
And then from there, it keeps
getting passed on from one

415
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,020
molecule to another.

416
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,069
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in the next video.

417
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:26,073
But this is fascinating.

418
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:28,039
Look how complicated this is.

419
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,021
In order to essentially excite
electrons and then use those

420
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:36,005
electrons to start the
process of pumping

421
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,020
hydrogens across a membrane.

422
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,029
And this is an interesting
place right here.

423
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,095
This is the water
oxidation site.

424
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:44,036
So I got very excited about the
idea of oxidizing water.

425
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:48,014
And so this is actually where
it occurs in the photosystem

426
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,024
II complex.

427
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,022
And you actually have this very
complicated mechanism.

428
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:54,088
Because it's no joke to actually
strip away electrons

429
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:58,010
and hydrogens from an actual
water molecule.

430
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll leave you there.

431
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,086
And in the next video I'll talk
a little bit more about

432
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,089
these energy states.

433
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,038
And I'll fill in a little bit of
the gaps about what some of

434
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,099
these other molecules that act
as hydrogen acceptors.

435
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,047
Or you can also view
them as electron

436
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:15,034
acceptors along the way.

437
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:15,054

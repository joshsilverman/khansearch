00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:02,044
In the first video on evolution,

2
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:07,076
I drew something that I called an ape, and then I drew a tail on it.

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:11,071
And what I want to do in this video is clarify that that was absolutely wrong.

4
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,086
Apes - Apes have no tails.

5
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:20,080
And it's actually one of the main distinguishing characteristics of apes.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,033
There's obviously other primates that also have no tails,

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,066
but apes definitely have no tails.

8
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:30,079
And just to clarify, there's kind of two families within apes

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,013
and their common names are "the lesser apes" and "the great apes."

10
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:40,015
And the lesser apes - the lesser apes are things like gibbons, lesser apes,

11
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:43,059
And the great apes are things like chimpanzees and gorillas,

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,042
and, and me, or human beings!

13
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:50,054
So these right here, these are the great apes.

14
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:53,034
These are the great apes.

15
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:58,003
And clearly this great ape right here did not have a great sense of style

16
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,069
in 1994.

17
00:00:59,069 --> 99:59:59,000
And really didn't feel the need to have a haircut.

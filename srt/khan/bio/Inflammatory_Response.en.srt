1
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:03,056
We've all had cuts on our finger
or wherever else on our

2
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:06,032
body, and immediately that part
of the body gets a little

3
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:16,021
bit of redness, a little bit of
swelling, some heat maybe,

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:18,080
and, of course, there'll be
some pain associated with

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,003
what's going on there.

6
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:24,014
And in general, this set of
symptoms that we experience,

7
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,037
these are known as the
inflammatory response, or you

8
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:29,021
might say that there's some
inflammation going on there.

9
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:32,067
And people have known about this
I guess ever since really

10
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:35,022
people have been having cuts.

11
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:38,025
I think probably with modern
medicine, people have been a

12
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:41,003
little bit more particular about
actually classifying the

13
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,064
symptoms, but this isn't
anything new for someone to

14
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,088
say that there's some type of
inflammation going on or some

15
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,038
type of inflammatory response.

16
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:51,007
But what I want to do in this
video is understand what's

17
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,032
causing these-- I guess we can
call them macrosymptoms.

18
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,013
What's happening at
a cellular level?

19
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,047
Because, really, the
inflammatory response is

20
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:01,014
essentially the initial
field of battle

21
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:02,053
of our immune system.

22
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:06,009
Our first line of defense is our
skin or the fluids on the

23
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,035
outside of our skin or the
mucous membranes, but the

24
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,006
inflammatory response is what
happens when something gets

25
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:12,078
beyond that.

26
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:15,087
We get punctured with a nail, or
there's some type of virus

27
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:21,000
or bacteria gets beyond our
skin or the mucus that

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,025
surrounds our membranes.

29
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,095


30
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:31,015
This is the field of battle,
especially the

31
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,082
initial field of battle.

32
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:37,093
So let's set up an immune battle
so we can see exactly

33
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:41,000
what's going on with the
inflammatory response.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,004
And I want to be very clear.

35
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:47,082
Immunology, is still a very
under understood field.

36
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,040
It's an area of active
research.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,051
People are still discovering
the mechanisms

38
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,026
and it's hugely complex.

39
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,051
I'm sure we'll probably
be studying this for a

40
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,054
long time to come.

41
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:58,025
So what I'm going to talk about
is just the overview,

42
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,070
just you know the general actors
and you know in general

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,076
what's causing the redness,
the swelling, the

44
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:04,003
heat, and the pain.

45
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:05,085
So let me draw some
skin cells.

46
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:09,006


47
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,088
This is a gross
oversimplification of

48
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,081
everything, but it's really just
to give an idea of what

49
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,090
is going on.

50
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,041
So I'm going to do
a cross-section.

51
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:20,021
So those are some skin cells in
there, and then I'm going

52
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,018
to-- so this is the outside
world right here.

53
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:25,012


54
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,077
Then amongst those skin cells,
I'll do some other cells.

55
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:28,081
We'll talk about what they do.

56
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,034
I won't go into huge
detail about them.

57
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:35,040
Let's call this cell right
here a mast cell.

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,025
I'll draw a few more
mast cells.

59
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,011
Maybe another one right there.

60
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,050
That's a mast cell.

61
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,050
And if you remember from the
videos on phagocytic action or

62
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,047
phagocytes, you'll remember
there was one type called

63
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:51,071
dendritic cells and they tend
to hang out near our skin.

64
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,043
They kind of hang out near areas
that might interface

65
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,037
with the outside world.

66
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,063
I'll draw a couple of dendritic
cells and these are

67
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:59,068
also the ones that were
really good at

68
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:03,055
activating helper T-cells.

69
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:11,047


70
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,037
They're called dendritic
cells.

71
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:14,044
They have no relation to
the nervous system.

72
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,043
They just look like they have
dendrites on them and that's

73
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:19,016
why they call them dendritic,
but they're really phagocytes

74
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:24,080
and they tend to be near
external interfaces and they

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,053
phagocytose particles and
they're good at presenting

76
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,015
them to helper T-cells so that
they can get activated and

77
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:31,087
ring the alarm bell,
so to speak.

78
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,087
So this is just a normal,
functioning, happy skin.

79
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:36,028
So that's the outside.

80
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,016
Over here, this is the
interstitial fluid.

81
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:43,019


82
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,074
That's just a fancy word for the
fluid that cells are kind

83
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:50,021
of being surrounded by
or that bathe cells.

84
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,034
The cells aren't all directly
connected to

85
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,053
the circulatory system.

86
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:56,018
The oxygen goes from the
circulatory system to the

87
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,024
interstitial fluid and
eventually finds

88
00:03:58,024 --> 00:03:59,025
its way into cells.

89
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:03,037
So everything is directly
connected to capillaries, but

90
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:05,056
capillaries play a big role
in our circulatory system.

91
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,046
So let me draw that.

92
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,081
Instead of just drawing them as
tubes, I'm actually going

93
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,036
to draw the cells of our
circulatory system.

94
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:14,012
So let's say that this down
here-- these are the

95
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:17,067
endothelial cells of
our capillaries.

96
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:21,031
So these are literally the cells
that make up the walls

97
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,056
of our capillaries.

98
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:32,010


99
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,049
And of course, this is
a cross-section.

100
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:36,041
If I were to-- I would draw
it as a tube somehow.

101
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,042
It's not like it's a sandwich.

102
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,093
It's actually a tube.

103
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,004
Everything is in
cross-section.

104
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:55,016
So these are capillary
endothelial cells, and of

105
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:58,085
course, right in here, we have
our blood flowing and we'll

106
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,045
have red blood cells in here.

107
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,031


108
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:04,060
These are red blood cells.

109
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,005
Maybe they're flowing
in that direction.

110
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,038
On this side, they're
oxygenated.

111
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,025
This would be arteries and then
they'd become veins as

112
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,057
the red blood cells
lose their oxygen.

113
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:16,094
And of course, you might have
circulating white blood cells

114
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:21,047
inside of your-- obviously, in
much lower quantity than your

115
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:23,057
red blood cells, but just to
show that they're circulating

116
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,093
and they're moving with your
circulatory system being

117
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,063
pumped by the heart.

118
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,050
Now under normal circumstances,
there is an

119
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,020
exchange obviously of gases
between what's going on in our

120
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,001
circulatory system and the
interstitial fluid and there's

121
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:40,013
also a mild exchange of some
cells and proteins.

122
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,094
What we're going to see
now is what happens

123
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,008
when we have an intruder.

124
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,043
So let's say someone takes a
nail, dips it in some cow

125
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:50,017
manure, and then pokes
you with that nail.

126
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,042
Let's see what happens.

127
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:57,073


128
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:00,010
So let's say someone pokes
you with this nail

129
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,037
dipped in cow manure.

130
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:07,056
So it's got all sorts of nasty
stuff on it, pathogens on it,

131
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:09,073
probably has a bunch
of bacteria

132
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:11,024
sitting in the cow manure.

133
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:13,000
I didn't pick cow manure
at random.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,092
It's probably a good
source of bacteria.

135
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:19,072
So as soon as it pierces the
first line of defense, as soon

136
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:22,031
as it pierces your skin,
a couple of things

137
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:22,082
are going to happen.

138
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,074
A lot of these bacteria are
immediately going to start

139
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:29,086
floating around in your
interstitial fluid.

140
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:32,031
The cells that it came in
contact with, it pierced them.

141
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:33,056
It probably killed some cells.

142
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:36,099
It's also going to damage some
of these skin cells and those

143
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,086
skin cells are immediately
going to start releasing

144
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:42,012
chemicals, the ones that are
still in a position to do so.

145
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,052
They're going to start releasing
chemicals that are

146
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:46,051
essentially chemical messengers
that move through

147
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:49,036
the-- well, at first locally in
the interstitial fluid and

148
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:50,097
says, something is going on.

149
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:52,088
Something has happened to me.

150
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,013
And these are called
chemokines.

151
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,056


152
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,095
And chemokines are just a very
general word, really, for

153
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,011
small molecules or small
proteins that cells release as

154
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,056
a kind of signaling mechanism.

155
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:10,017
Chemo for chemical, kine for
kinetic, for moving.

156
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,056
These are messengers.

157
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,045
They move.

158
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,079
So these chemokines
get released.

159
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,012
And this is all tremendously
complicated.

160
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,083
So I'm doing very high level.

161
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,097
There are many, many types
of chemokines.

162
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:23,016
And also you have these mast
cells here, and these mast

163
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:26,056
cells can be activated by direct
contact maybe with the

164
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:27,043
rusty nail.

165
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:31,014
It could be from the chemokines
released by some of

166
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,050
these cells up here.

167
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,045
It could be from some of the
molecules released by the

168
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:36,087
actual bacteria.

169
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:40,080
These bacteria are also
releasing different byproducts

170
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,035
as they enter the body.

171
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:48,001
And any of the above can
activate the mast cells and

172
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,043
mast cells release histamine.

173
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:56,087


174
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,091
So you can already appreciate,
I'm doing a high-level

175
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:01,027
overview, and it already is
kind of complicated, but I

176
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,087
think you get the sense
of what's going on.

177
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:07,026
And if the word histamine sounds
vaguely familiar, it's

178
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:11,004
probably because you've taken
an antihistamine sometime

179
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,080
probably in the last
several months,

180
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,024
especially during cold season.

181
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:18,058
Histamine is kind of one of
the main actors in the

182
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:20,083
inflammatory response, and when
you have a cold and a

183
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,075
runny nose and stuffy nose and
all of those type of things,

184
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:29,094
those are all byproducts of the
inflammatory response, and

185
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:32,087
anti-histamines essentially
try to shut down that

186
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:36,000
inflammatory response so some
of those symptoms disappear.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,049
But it begs the question
of is that necessarily

188
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,041
always a good thing?

189
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,053
Because, as I'm going to talk
about in this video, this is

190
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,087
the first line of defense.

191
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:46,069
This is the first part of the
battle of our immune system.

192
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,033
But anyway, so the histamine--
one of the things that the

193
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:54,046
histamine does is it goes to
the endothelial cells that

194
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:58,075
line your capillaries, and it
causes them to separate away

195
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:03,039
from each other and make the
actual capillaries larger.

196
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,064
This is called vasodilation.

197
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:15,055


198
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,096
Let's say that they've all been
activated with a little

199
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,021
bit of histamine.

200
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:23,067


201
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,090
The histamine has come
in so now these

202
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,011
guys get further apart.

203
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,012
They get further apart
and the actual

204
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,039
capillary becomes larger.

205
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:35,080


206
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,077
So this is where you get a lot
of your swelling, because all

207
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,037
of sudden, the capillary's
larger, more fluid, and

208
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:44,011
actually, it gets smaller
further down so it really

209
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:47,077
encourages the fluid to collect
right around here.

210
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:51,019
So this is called vasodilation,
just another

211
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,096
fancy word for saying your

212
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,047
capillaries are getting dlated.

213
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:55,041
They're getting larger.

214
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,041
Fluid is filling them up.

215
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,089
Not only are things starting
to collect here-- more and

216
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,083
more red blood cells are
collecting here, obviously

217
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,058
there's a lot of fluid here,
the white blood cells-- but

218
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:09,039
also the capillary walls are
becoming more porous.

219
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,082
All of a sudden, things that
couldn't get through them are

220
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:14,027
going to have a much easier
time getting through them.

221
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:16,080
And one of those things that
are going to have an easier

222
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,075
time getting through them-- and
once again, remember, all

223
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,021
this other stuff is going on.

224
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:24,039
You have these histamines that
are being dumped on these

225
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,035
endothelial cells and
maybe some of it 's

226
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:27,034
getting into the serum.

227
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:31,052
You have these chemokines being
released locally from

228
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,091
this area of damage.

229
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:35,054
You have the actual things
being-- the green was the

230
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:38,087
color of the molecules being
released by the viruses.

231
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,033
You have the chemokines,
which are in blue.

232
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:44,082
They're all being
released here.

233
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:48,060
And so the first responders,
the phagocytes, and in

234
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,059
particular, the neutrophils,
which are the most abundant of

235
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,050
the phagocytes, a subclass of
white blood cells, they're

236
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,073
attracted to these chemicals.

237
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,075
They want to move in the
direction that there's more of

238
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,065
these chemicals.

239
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:03,079
And now that the space between
these capillary cells have

240
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,044
gotten further apart, they
can get through.

241
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:08,085
So what they actually do is--
let's say that this right here

242
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,010
is a neutrophil.

243
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,098


244
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:17,052
They start kind of rolling along
the wall right here.

245
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,042


246
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,033
That's called margination.

247
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:23,030
They roll along this wall and
eventually-- so they kind of

248
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,060
stick to the wall.

249
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,061
They adhere to the wall, and
then eventually they squeeze

250
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:32,064
through these gaps in
the capillary wall.

251
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:36,022
This is called diapedesis
or extravasation.

252
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:38,011
Sometimes it's called
emigration.

253
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,079
These are all fancy words,
but essentially it's just

254
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,091
squeezing through the walls.

255
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,062
So that's the neutrophil
right there.

256
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:45,026
And then, of course, because of
the vasodilation, this is

257
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:48,012
where the neutrophils will be
getting dumped in and this is

258
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,079
exactly where they're needed.

259
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,009
So these neutrophils are going
to be here and then they're

260
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:52,087
going to do what they do.

261
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,080
They're going to phagocytose
some of these bacteria and

262
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,033
start eating up, and
maybe even some

263
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,024
damaged cells up here.

264
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,046
And so that's what you
want to happen.

265
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:01,086
That's why I said this is
the field of battle.

266
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:04,030
At the same time, your dendritic
cells, other

267
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,042
phagocytes, they will eat up the
viruses and then they'll

268
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,052
present them on their
surfaces.

269
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:12,098
And it's not just neutrophils
that are coming in.

270
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:17,024
Because this is kind of an area
of congestion and all of

271
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:21,040
the fluid is coming here, you'll
also have B-cells and

272
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,017
T-cells that'll also
make their way.

273
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:27,084
They'll also experience
marginalization, where they

274
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:32,012
roll up against the sides of
the capillary and then

275
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:35,089
diapedesis or extravasation
where they go through, and

276
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,066
then they'll be activated, and
they can actually do the

277
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,049
specific immune system.

278
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,084
So the whole point here is I
wanted to show you-- and this

279
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:45,073
is why I delayed the whole
video on the inflammatory

280
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:49,044
response, because it isn't just
one type of simple thing.

281
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:51,083
It's actually the field of
battle where all of the actors

282
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,039
come and play, even the first
line of defense of your skin,

283
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,048
and then all of the actors, the
nonspecific reactions of--

284
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,061
inflammatory response is
normally categorized as

285
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,051
nonspecific because it's going
to happen no matter what

286
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:05,045
comes, but you have the
nonspecific actors like the

287
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,032
neutrophils.

288
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:11,060
You have your specific actors
like your B-cells and T-cells

289
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,088
and you also have the
nonspecific complement system.

290
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:15,058
And I'm not going to go into
detail here, but you actually

291
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:19,099
have proteins that are flowing
in your blood plasma that are

292
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:23,064
normally in an inactive state,
but when the inflammatory

293
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:27,004
response occurs, these proteins,
they get essentially

294
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,094
activated and sometimes-- and
this is all not 100% well

295
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:32,049
understood-- they become
activated, they get cleaved

296
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,060
up, and then the cleaved-up
versions of those proteins are

297
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,007
really good at, in a very
nonspecific way, helping to

298
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,076
kill off at least some of what's
getting-- maybe the

299
00:13:43,076 --> 00:13:44,097
bacteria in this case.

300
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:46,099
So this right here, this is the
complement system, which

301
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:49,060
is really just a set of proteins
that always just

302
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,007
floats around and they are a
good kind of first line of

303
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:57,095
nonspecific fight against some
type of invading pathogen.

304
00:13:57,095 --> 00:14:02,047
So hopefully, this gives you a
good sense of what is going on

305
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:04,040
in the inflammatory response.

306
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,066
And as you can imagine, you have
all of this fluid coming

307
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:09,021
here, all of this blood
is collecting here.

308
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:13,017
You have all of this fluid
coming into-- so not just

309
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:16,027
cells that are going from
our capillaries into our

310
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,096
interstitial fluid, you'll
actually have fluid going in

311
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:20,099
and that fluid that's going
in is called exudate.

312
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:23,079


313
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,000
So this whole thing become
swelling and red and engorged

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,017
and that's why you see, on kind
of a very macro level,

315

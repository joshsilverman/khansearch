1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,088
I'm sure many of y'all have
already heard of the molecule

3
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:08,098
DNA, and it stands for
deoxyribonucleic acid.

4
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:11,060
I wrote it out ahead of time
to spare you the pain of

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,074
watching me spell this
in real time.

6
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:15,085
But it is-- and I think you
already have an idea.

7
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:21,017
This is the basic unit of
heredity, or it's what codes

8
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:23,078
all of our genetic
information.

9
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:25,076
And what I want to do in this
video-- because I think that's

10
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:26,091
kind of common knowledge.

11
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:30,023
That's popular knowledge that,
oh, everything that makes my

12
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:34,064
hair black or my eyes blue or
whatever, that's all somehow

13
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:36,032
encoded in our DNA.

14
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:39,049
But what I want to do in this
video is give you an idea of

15
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:43,002
how something like DNA, a
molecule, can actually code

16
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,050
for what we are.

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,039
How does the information, one,
get stored in this type of a

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,024
molecule, then how does that
actually turn into the

19
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:54,060
proteins that make up our
enzymes and our organs and our

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,077
brain cells and everything else
that really make us us?

21
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:04,040
So this is a computer graphics
representation of DNA, and I'm

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,085
sure many of y'all have heard
of the double helix.

23
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:11,040


24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,045
And that's in reference to the
structure that DNA takes.

25
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,085
And you can see here it's
a double helix.

26
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:20,056
As you can see here, you have
two of these lines, and

27
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:23,045
they're intertwined
with each other.

28
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:27,054
You see there, that's one of
them, and then you see another

29
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,076
one intertwined like that.

30
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:33,018
And then they're connected by--
you can almost view it as

31
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:38,078
like these bridges between the
two helixes, and they twist

32
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,057
around each other.

33
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,067
I think you get the idea.

34
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,095
So the double helix just
describes the structure, the

35
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:47,070
shape that DNA takes, and
it leads to all sorts of

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,079
interesting repercussions in
terms of how heredity takes

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,032
place and how natural selection
and variation might

38
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,034
take place as well.

39
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:59,085
And actually, in the future, I
do want to actually read with

40
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:04,034
you Watson and Crick's paper on
the double helix where they

41
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,082
essentially talk about
their discovery.

42
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:08,066
The best thing about that paper,
besides the fact that

43
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,012
it was probably one of the
biggest discoveries in the

44
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:14,037
history of mankind, is that the
paper is only a page and a

45
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:17,094
half long, and it goes to my
general view that if you have

46
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,043
something good to say,
it shouldn't take you

47
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,050
that long to say it.

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,087
But with that said, let's think
a little bit about how

49
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:26,059
this can actually generate the
proteins and whatever else

50
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:29,024
that make up all of us.

51
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:34,028
So right here this is a
zoomed-up version of that

52
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:37,013
graphic that I just showed you a
little bit earlier, and this

53
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:38,062
is each of the helixes.

54
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:44,074
So if this is the magenta side,
if you unwound this

55
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:47,053
helix-- right now it shows it
in its wound state, but if I

56
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:54,000
unwind this helix, one side
would maybe be this magenta

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,034
side of our helix and
then one side is

58
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:00,087
this green side, right?

59
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,040
And if you twist it up,
you get back to

60
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,011
this drawing up here.

61
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,065
And then these bridges that you
see in this drawing in the

62
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:10,087
double helix, those are these
connections right here.

63
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,012
These are the bridges.

64
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:15,003


65
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:21,040
Now, what allows us to code
information is that the blocks

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,003
that make up the bridges are
made of different molecules.

67
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,025
And the four different molecules
that are made up in

68
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:31,066
DNA are adenine-- and
it's written here

69
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,038
on this little chart.

70
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:34,037
I got all of this from
Wikipedia, so if you want more

71
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,031
information I encourage
you to go there.

72
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:39,019
Adenine, that's up here.

73
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,024
This is the molecular structure
of adenine.

74
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:47,027
It's connected to a sugar
right here, ribose.

75
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,090
I won't go into a deoxyribose.

76
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,059
And then you have your
phosphate group.

77
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:55,084
But these kind of form the
backbone of the DNA: the sugar

78
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,077
and the phosphate groups.

79
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,041
And I'm not going to go into
the microbiology of it,

80
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,009
because that's not important
right now to understanding

81
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:04,077
just how does this intuitively
code for what we are.

82
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,062
So along the backbone, which
is identical, and

83
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:08,024
we'll talk about it.

84
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,055
They run in different
directions.

85
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:12,096
It's called antiparallel,
so they label the ends.

86
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,050
And I'm not going to go into
detail there, but the

87
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,054
important thing are
these bases here.

88
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:26,018
So you have adenine, and adenine
pairs with thymine,

89
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,063
and you see that up here.

90
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:31,047
If you have an adenine molecule
here, an adenine base

91
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:33,055
here, it'll pair with
thymine, and this is

92
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,058
called the base pair.

93
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:36,050
Adenine and thymine pair
with each other.

94
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,047
If you have thymine, it's going
to pair with adenine.

95
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,079
And then you have guanine and
it pairs with cytosine.

96
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,011


97
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,048
And the names of these, you
should know these names, just

98
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:54,019
because they are almost-- well,
if you ever enter any

99
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:56,055
discussion about DNA
and base pairs,

100
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:59,031
this is expected knowledge.

101
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:02,025
But the names of the molecules
and how they're structured,

102
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,083
not important just yet.

103
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,029
But what's important is the fact
that there are four of

104
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,006
them and that they essentially
code information.

105
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,056
So you can view one of these
strands in kind of a

106
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:13,041
simplified way.

107
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:17,027
You can just view it as a strand
of-- so this one, if it

108
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:24,060
has an adenine and then
it has a cytosine,

109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,037
then it has a guanine.

110
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,005
That's a guanine.

111
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:29,029
They did it in purple.

112
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,005
And then it has a-- oh, no, it
has a thymine, not a guanine.

113
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:36,008
So it has a thymine in
purple, and then in

114
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,016
blue, it has a guanine.

115
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:41,087
So this strand right
here codes ACTG.

116
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,047
And if you were to code the
opposite side of the strand,

117
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,077
you could immediately-- I don't
even have to look here.

118
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:49,055
I can look at this side and
say, OK, adenine will pair

119
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:58,005
with thymine, cytosine pairs
with guanine, thymine pairs

120
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:01,033
with adenine, and guanine
pairs with cytosine.

121
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,052
So they're complementary
strands.

122
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,098
So if you think about
it, they're really

123
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,054
coding the same thing.

124
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:08,098
If you have one of them, you
have all of the information

125
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:10,081
for the other.

126
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:15,081
Now, in our DNA, in a human's
DNA, you might say, hey, Sal,

127
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:22,012
how do I go from these little
chains of these molecules?

128
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,075
How does that turn into me?

129
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:26,008
How does that turn into
this complex organism?

130
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:30,051
And the simple answer is, well,
the human genome has

131
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,050
three billion of these
base pairs.

132
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:39,012


133
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:41,023
And that's actually just in
half of your chromosomes.

134
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:44,004
And I'll tell you, maybe in this
video or a future video,

135
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,054
why we only consider half of
your chromosomes, and that's

136
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:53,014
because essentially you have
a pair of every chromosome.

137
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,018
I'll talk in more detail
about that.

138
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:58,088
And this number, to some people,
they might say, it

139
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:04,042
only takes three billion base
pairs to describe who I am?

140
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:08,025
And some people would say, wow,
it takes three billion

141
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:09,049
base pairs to describe
who I am.

142
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,006
I never thought I was
that complex.

143
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,038
So depending on your point of
view, this is either a large

144
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:14,056
or small number.

145
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:16,081
But when you take these three
billion base pairs, you're

146
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:19,089
actually encoding all of the
information that it takes to

147
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,056
make in this case
a human being.

148
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:25,032
And actually it turns out a
lot of primates don't have

149
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:29,044
that many different base pairs
than human beings.

150
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,079
The amazing thing is even things
like roundworms and

151
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:38,000
fruit flies also number in a
surprisingly large fraction of

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,060
the base pairs of
a human being.

153
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,068
Maybe I'll do another
video where I go

154
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,072
into comparative biology.

155
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:48,037
But how do these base pairs
actually lead to proteins?

156
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,052
I mean, it's fair enough.

157
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,047
That's information.

158
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:53,010
It's like you can view these
as ones and zeroes in some

159
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,068
type of computer language, but
really they're not just ones

160
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,013
and zeroes, because they can
take on four different values.

161
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:01,086
They can take on an A, a T, a
C or a G, so you could think

162
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:04,093
of them as zero, ones, twos
and threes, but I won't go

163
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,083
into that whole aspect
of it just now.

164
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:10,033
So how does that actually
code information?

165
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:17,068
So DNA when it actually
transcribes something-- the

166
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:24,034
process is called transcription,
and I'm going

167
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:27,000
to do a pretty gross
simplification of it, but I

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,044
think it'll give you the gist of
how it codes for proteins.

169
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,048
So what happens when
transcription happens is that

170
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:35,098
these two strands split up, and
one of the strands-- let

171
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,088
me just take one of them.

172
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:37,083
Let's say it looks like this.

173
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,058
I'll do it all in one color.

174
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:47,092
Let's say it's just ATGGACG--
I'm just making up stuff-- TA.

175
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,078
Let's say that that's the strand
that got split up.

176
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:54,008
And what happens is
it transcribes--

177
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,005
and I won't say itself.

178
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:59,030
There's a whole bunch of enzymes
and proteins and a

179
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,005
whole bunch of chemical
reactions that have to happen,

180
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:07,004
but this DNA essentially
transcribes a

181
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,001
complementary mRNA.

182
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,025
And I'll introduce RNA.

183
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:14,080


184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,092
It's essentially the exact same
thing as-- well, the word

185
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:21,062
is ribonucleic acid, so it's
literally-- you get rid of the

186
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:24,063
deoxy, so you can kind of say
it's got its oxy, and it's

187
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,000
ribonucleic acid, but it's
very similar to DNA.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,096
It codes in the exact
same way.

189
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:37,025
The only difference between RNA,
instead of a thymine, it

190
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:40,075
has something called a uracil.

191
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:43,075
So every place where you would
have expected a thymine, you

192
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:46,051
would have expected a T,
you'll now see a U.

193
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:51,025
So, for example, if this is the
DNA strand, then an RNA,

194
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,051
an mRNA, in a messenger RNA
strand, will be built

195
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,077
complementary to this.

196
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,007
So it'll be built-- let's see.

197
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:59,030
With A, you'd normally have
thymine when you're talking

198
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,017
DNA, but now we're talking RNA,
so it'll be a uracil,

199
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:09,025
then an adenine, cytosine,
cytosine, uracil, then we got

200
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:14,007
a guanine, a cytosine,
an adenine, and then

201
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:14,076
we'll have a uracil.

202
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:18,023
So this is the mRNA
strand here.

203
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:19,082
And all of this is occurring
inside the

204
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:22,050
nucleus of your cells.

205
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,066
And we'll do a whole series of
videos in the future about the

206
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:30,099
structure of our cells, but I
think most of us know that our

207
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:34,090
cells-- and I'll talk more
about eukaryotic and

208
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,022
prokaryotic organisms in the
future, but most complex

209
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:39,086
organisms, they have a cell
nucleus where we have all of

210
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,053
our chromosomes that contain
all of our DNA.

211
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:48,069
And so this mRNA then detaches
itself from the DNA that it

212
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:52,039
was transcribed from, and then
it leaves the nucleus, and it

213
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,095
goes to these structures
called ribosomes.

214
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:57,036
I'm oversimplifying it a
little bit, but at the

215
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:02,050
ribosomes, this mRNA is
translated into proteins.

216
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,045
So let me do that.

217
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,036
So let's say this is the mRNA.

218
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:08,077
It was transcribed from that
DNA, so let me get

219
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:12,032
rid of that DNA now.

220
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,029
I got rid of the DNA.

221
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,099
This is the mRNA that we were
able to transcribe from that

222
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:19,022
DNA, and they have these
other things called

223
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:21,060
tRNA or transfer RNA.

224
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,023
And what these are--
and this is the

225
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,092
really interesting part.

226
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:28,023
So you may or may not know that
pretty much everything we

227
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:30,020
are is made up of proteins.

228
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,061
And these proteins, the building
blocks of proteins

229
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,078
are amino acids.

230
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,037
And for those of you who like
to lift weights, I'm sure

231
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:41,012
you've seen ads for amino
acid supplements and

232
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,063
things of the like.

233
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:45,041
And the reason why they talk
about amino acids is because

234
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:49,039
those are the building
blocks of proteins.

235
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,020
My son actually has an allergy
to milk protein, so we had to

236
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,069
get him a formula that was just
pure amino acids, just

237
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,051
all of the milk proteins
broken down.

238
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:04,025
So if you look at a protein,
it's actually a chain of these

239
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:07,024
amino acids and usually
a fairly long chain.

240
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:11,075
We'll look at some protein
structures in the very near

241
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:14,009
future, just to give you
an idea of things.

242
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,054
It's a very long chain of these
amino acids, and there

243
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:20,070
are actually 20 different
amino acids.

244
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,075
Twenty different amino acids are
pretty much the structure

245
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,099
of all of our proteins.

246
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,024
Let me write that.

247
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:30,078


248
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,007
So a very obvious question is
how can these things code for

249
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,004
20 different amino acids?

250
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:40,037
I can only have four different
things in this little bucket

251
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:41,040
right here.

252
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,087
And then you just have to go
back to your combinatorics, or

253
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:48,050
if you can't go back to it
to watch the playlist on

254
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,028
probability and combinatorics,
and say, OK, there's only four

255
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:56,009
ways that I can have for
each of these bases.

256
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,060
There's only four different
bases that I can have here,

257
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,053
either an adenine guanine,
cytosine or, depending on

258
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,076
whether we're talking
about DNA or RNA,

259
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,098
a uracil or a thymine.

260
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,080
But how can we increase
the combinations?

261
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,045
Well, if we include two of them,
if we include two bases,

262
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:16,035
then how many combinations
can we have?

263
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,025
Well, we have four possibilities
here, then we'd

264
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:22,019
have four possibilities here, so
we'd have 16 possibilities.

265
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,085
But that's still not enough.

266
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:27,079
That's still not enough to code
for one of 20 amino acids

267
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,008
to say, hey, this is going to
code for amino acid number

268
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,095
five, and we'll talk more about
their actual names.

269
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,082
So what do we have to do?

270
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,074
Well, we have to use
three of them.

271
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:40,003
So three of them, there's
actually four times four times

272
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:44,001
four possibilities here, so
they could code for 64

273
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:45,061
different things.

274
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:49,016
They could take on 64 different
combinations or

275
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:51,066
permutations, this
UAC right here.

276
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:54,099
So if we have three of these
bases, we can actually code

277
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,039
for an amino acid.

278
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,058
Actually, it's overkill, because
we can actually have

279
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:02,050
64 combinations here, and there
are only 20 amino acids,

280
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,040
so we can even have redundant
combinations code for

281
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,047
different amino acids.

282
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:11,021
For example, we might say
that, and this isn't the

283
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:14,035
actual code, but maybe UAC, and
I should look these up.

284
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:18,001
This codes for amino
acid number 1.

285
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:24,073
And if it was AAU, then this
codes for amino acid number 2.

286
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:29,042
And if I have-- I mean, I
think you get the idea.

287
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:35,011
If I have GGG, this codes for
amino acid number 10.

288
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:38,049
And what happens is when this
messenger RNA leaves the

289
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:41,033
nucleus, it goes to the
ribosomes, and at the

290
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:44,062
ribosomes-- we're going to look
at that diagram in a few

291
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:49,047
seconds-- but at the ribosomes--
let me take my

292
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:53,094
same mRNA molecule.

293
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,057
And they're much longer than
what I'm showing here.

294
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,070
This is just a fraction
of an mRNA molecule.

295
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,008


296
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:04,070
So I'll take my mRNA molecule,
and what they do is they

297
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,062
essentially act as a template
for tRNA molecules.

298
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:12,026
And tRNA molecules are these
molecules that are attached to

299
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:15,030
the-- they're almost like the
trucks for the amino acids.

300
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,061
So let's say I have some amino
acid right here, and then I

301
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:22,037
have another amino acid that's
right here like that, and then

302
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:25,011
I have another amino acid
that's like that.

303
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,029
They'll be attached
to tRNA molecules.

304
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:33,087
So let's say that this tRNA
molecule has on it-- so this

305
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:37,037
amino acid is attached to a
tRNA molecule that has the

306
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:42,057
code on it A-- let me do
it in a darker color.

307
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,041
It has the code AUG.

308
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:48,080


309
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:56,089
This one right here has
the code-- let me

310
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,064
pick another one.

311
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,089
Let's say it has GGAC.

312
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:03,029


313
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,028
So what's going to happen?

314
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:07,021
When you're in the ribosome, and
it's a complex situation,

315
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,075
but actually what's happening
isn't too fancy.

316
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:14,037
This tRNA, it wants to bond
to this part of the mRNA.

317
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:14,084
Why?

318
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:19,066
Because adenine bonds with
uracil, uracil bonds with

319
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,094
adenine, and guanine bonds with
cyotsine, so it'll pull

320
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:23,092
up right here.

321
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,097
It'll pull up right next to this
thing, and actually, I

322
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:29,091
should probably-- well, I don't
know if I can rotate it.

323
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:32,052
But it'll just pull up
right here and attach

324
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,079
to this mRNA molecule.

325
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,005
And this right here is tRNA.

326
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:37,092


327
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:39,045
This is mRNA.

328
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,040
And the names don't matter.

329
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,050
I really just want to give you
the big picture idea of how

330
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,049
the proteins are actually
formed.

331
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,096
And this is an amino acid.

332
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:49,060
I don't know, let's call it
amino acid 1, amino acid 5,

333
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,009
amino acid 20.

334
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,066
This guy, he's going to
pull up right here.

335
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,052
The guanine is attracted to the
cytosine, and if you watch

336
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,074
the chemistry videos, these are
actually hydrogen bonds

337
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:01,040
that form the base pairs.

338
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,038
Adenine, wants to pull up to
uracil, cytosine to guanine,

339
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:06,057
and so on and so forth.

340
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,043
And so once all of these
guys have pulled

341
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:09,097
up-- let me do that.

342
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:13,002
So once you've pulled up, let's
say that this is-- I

343
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:14,074
could do it up here.

344
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,072
This is my mRNA molecule.

345
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:19,018
I'm not going to draw the
specifics right there.

346
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:24,033
My little tRNA's pull up, pull
up next to it, and they each

347
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,047
hold a payload, right?

348
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,025
So this first one holds this
payload right here of this

349
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,023
amino acid.

350
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:33,083
The second one holds this
payload of this amino acid and

351
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,079
so forth and so on.

352
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,002
And so it might keep going,
and there's another green

353
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:40,086
amino acid here.

354
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:43,023
They really don't have those
colors, but I'm just-- just

355
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:45,029
for the sake of simplicity
like that.

356
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,088
And then the amino acids bond
to each other when they're

357
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,059
held like that close
to each other.

358
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,035
This doesn't happen
all by itself.

359
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,085
The ribosome serves a purpose,
and there are enzymes that

360
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:58,021
facilitate this process, but
once these guys bond together,

361
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,016
the tRNA detaches,
and you have this

362
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:04,032
chain of amino acids.

363
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:08,058
And then the chain of amino
acids starts to bend around so

364
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:10,091
they have all of these-- and
it's actually a fascinating--

365
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:14,092
I mean, people spend their lives
studying how proteins

366
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,068
fold, and that's actually where
they get most of their

367
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:18,076
structural properties.

368
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:21,002
It's not just the chain of the
amino acids, but what's more

369
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:23,066
important is how these amino
acids actually fold.

370
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,088
So once you fold them, they form
these really ultracomplex

371
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:30,099
patterns based on what amino
acid is attracted to what

372
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:33,018
other amino acid in these
very intricate

373
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:34,081
three-dimensional shapes.

374
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:38,025
And what I took here from
Wikipedia is these are some

375
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:38,092
amino acids.

376
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:44,015
And just to be able to relate
this to the DNA, this right

377
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,022
here is insulin.

378
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:49,084
It's key in our ability to
process glucose in our body.

379
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:51,029
So this right here is insulin.

380
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,043
It's a hormone.

381
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,097
So sometimes you hear people
talk about your immune system.

382
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:57,010
Sometimes you hear people
talking about your endocrine

383
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,020
system and hormones, sometimes
your digestive system.

384
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,070
This is hemoglobin, what
essentially transports our

385
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,008
oxygen in our blood.

386
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:10,001
But all of these things are
proteins, and all these

387
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,050
little, little folds you see,
these are all little amino-- I

388
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,051
mean, they're just little
dots of amino acids.

389
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:19,080
Some of these are multiple
chains of amino acids kind of

390
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,025
fitting together like a big
puzzle, but some of them or

391
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,095
just single chains
of amino acids.

392
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:27,030
For insulin right here, this
is 50 amino acids.

393
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,084
And then once the chain forms,
it all bundles together and

394
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:34,071
forms this little blob like you
see, but the shape of that

395
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:38,034
blob is super important for
insulin being able to perform

396
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:41,086
the function that it needs to
perform in our systems.

397
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:47,003
But this right here is
approximately 50-- I forgot

398
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:49,014
the exact number--
amino acids.

399
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:53,021


400
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:59,067
This right here, this
immunoglobulin G, which is

401
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,075
part of our immune
system, this is

402
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:09,070
roughly 1,500 amino acids.

403
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,016
So how much DNA or how
many base pairs

404
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:12,099
had to code for this?

405
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,018
Well, three times
as much, right?

406
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:19,034
Because you have to have three
base pairs that code for one

407
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,049
amino acid, and actually, three
base pairs, this is

408
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:27,018
called a codon, because it
codes for amino acids.

409
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,038
So three base pairs
make a codon.

410
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,017
So if you have 50 amino acids
that make up insulin, that

411
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:34,023
means you're going to have to
have 50 codons, which means

412
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:39,094
you have to have 150 bases
or 150 of these

413
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,076
A's and G's and T's.

414
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:45,009
If you have 1,500 amino acids,
that means you're going to

415
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,042
have to have 1,500 codons, which
means you're going to

416
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:54,066
have roughly 4,500 of these base
pairs that code for it.

417
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:59,027
Now, there are some notions that
get confused a lot, so I

418
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:02,048
went to kind of the smallest
level of our DNA right here,

419
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:05,018
and this is the level at which--
well, this is RNA that

420
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:08,029
I'm pointing to right there, but
this is the smallest level

421
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,057
of DNA, and that's the level
at which the information is

422
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:11,031
actually coded.

423
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:14,049
But how does that relate to
things like genes and

424
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,070
chromosomes and things
that you might talk

425
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,018
about in other contexts?

426
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:20,085


427
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:25,088
So let's say the 150 base pairs
that coded for insulin,

428
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,051
these make up a gene.

429
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,059


430
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:36,045
And these 4,500 base pairs
make up another gene.

431
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:40,006
Now, all of the genes don't make
proteins, but all of the

432
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:41,072
proteins are made by genes.

433
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:45,094
So let's say I have just a
bunch of-- I'll just make

434
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:51,076
another A, G, and it goes down,
down, down, and you have

435
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,092
a T and then a C and a
C, and let's say I

436
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:57,083
have 4,500 of these.

437
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:01,048
These could code
for a protein.

438
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:03,031
These could code for protein,
or they could have all of

439
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:07,048
these other kind of regulatory
functions telling what other

440
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:10,040
parts of the DNA should and
should not be coded and how

441
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,086
the DNA behaves, so it becomes
super, super complex.

442
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:18,004
But this kind of section of our
DNA, this is what we refer

443
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:24,040
to as a gene, and a gene can
have anywhere from a couple of

444
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,099
hundreds of these base pairs
or these bases to several

445
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,085
thousand of these base pairs.

446
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:34,022
Now, a gene is that part of our
chromosome that codes for

447
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:37,092
a particular protein or serves
a certain function.

448
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,028
Now, there are different
versions of genes.

449
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:43,000


450
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,057
It's a gross oversimplification,
but let me

451
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:49,081
say this is the gene
for insulin.

452
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:53,003


453
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:56,065
Now, there might be slight
variations in how insulin can

454
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:59,088
be coded for, and I'm kind of
going out of my domain right

455
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:00,086
here, because I don't
know if that's true.

456
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,057
And maybe I shouldn't just
speak specifically about

457
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,085
insulin, but it's coding for
some protein, but there's

458
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,099
maybe multiple different
ways that that

459
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:08,047
protein can be coded.

460
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:11,053
Maybe instead of a T here,
sometimes there's a C there.

461
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:13,000
It still codes for
the same protein.

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,032
It doesn't change it quite
enough, but that protein acts

463
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:18,073
just a little bit different.

464
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:20,042
It's a slight variant.

465
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,075
I'll use that word.

466
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:24,084
Now, each variant of this gene
is called an allele.

467
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,053


468
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:34,084
It's a specific variant
of your gene.

469
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:37,046


470
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:45,023
Now, if you take this DNA chain,
and this chain over

471
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,083
here-- let's see.

472
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,091
This is one base pair.

473
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:50,000
This might be like one base.

474
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,020
This is another base.

475
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,043
Maybe this is an adenine and
then this would be a thymine

476
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:55,090
over here in green.

477
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,022
This is an adenine and this
would be a thymine.

478
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,056
If right here this is a guanine,
then right here would

479
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:03,071
be a cytosine.

480
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:05,060
This would be just a
very small section.

481
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,079
If I were to like zoom out, and
let's say we have a big

482
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,018
chain of DNA where each of these
little dots are a base

483
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:19,050
pair that I'm drawing here,
maybe this section

484
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:23,030
codes for gene 1.

485
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,063
And then there's some noise or
things that we haven't fully

486
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,011
understood yet.

487
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:26,094
Now, I want to be clear.

488
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:29,078
Just with a simple discussion of
DNA, we're already kind of

489
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:32,010
approaching the frontiers of
what we know and what we don't

490
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,089
know, because DNA is hugely
complex, and there's all of

491
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:38,029
these feedback structures, and
certain genes tell you to code

492
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:40,059
for other genes and not to code
for other genes and to

493
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:43,025
code under certain
circumstances, hugely complex.

494
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,004
So there's huge sections of
DNA that we still don't

495
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,099
understand what exactly
they do.

496
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,093
But then maybe they'll have
another section here that

497
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,047
codes for gene 2.

498
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,056
Maybe gene 2 is a little
bit longer.

499
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:54,050
Maybe it's 1,000 base pairs.

500
00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:00,038
But when you take all of these
and you turn it into a-- it

501
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,099
kind of winds in on
itself like this.

502
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:05,060
Let me do it.

503
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,098
So it'll wind up, winding in on
itself like this and do all

504
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:10,044
sorts of crazy things.

505
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:14,088
Remember, it completely bundles
itself up, and then it

506
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:16,029
looks something like that.

507
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:17,079
Then you get a chromosome.

508
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:20,054


509
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:24,061
And just to get an idea of how
large a chromosome is compared

510
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:29,008
to the actual base pairs,
chromosome number one in the

511
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:31,059
human genome-- so we
have 23 pairs.

512
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,014
If you look at it inside of a
nucleus-- so let's say that's

513
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:34,061
the nucleus.

514
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:35,072
Let's say this is the cell.

515
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:37,096
The cell is much bigger
than what I'm showing.

516
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:39,092
But we have 23 pairs
of chromosomes.

517
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:44,001


518
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,061
I won't do all of them.

519
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:47,027
You can actually see
chromosomes in a

520
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:50,028
not-too-expensive microscope, so
we're already getting to a

521
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,057
scale that we can start
to look at.

522
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:55,020
But the largest chromosome,
which is chromosome number one

523
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,036
in the human genome, just to
give an idea of how much

524
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:02,075
information it's packing, that
thing right there has 220

525
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:06,064
million base pairs.

526
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,096
Sometimes people talk about
chromosomes and genetics and

527
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:11,006
genes and base pairs
interchangeably, but it's very

528
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:12,073
important to kind of get
an idea of scale.

529
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:15,091
These chromosomes are a
super-long strand of DNA

530
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:18,084
that's all configured and
bundled up, and it contains

531
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:21,005
220 million base pairs.

532
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:23,092
So the actual elements that are
coding for the information

533
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:27,052
are unbelievably small
relative to

534
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,015
the chromosome itself.

535
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:31,025
But now that we understand a
little bit, and actually I

536
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:34,049
want to take a look back at
this, because this kind of

537
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:36,096
blows my mind, that if you
just take those little

538
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:40,036
combinations of those amino
acids, you can form these very

539
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,089
intricate, very advanced
structures that we're still

540
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:46,050
fully understanding how they
actually interact with each

541
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,015
other and regulate how all of
our biological processes work.

542
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:54,084
And what's even more amazing is
that this scheme that I've

543
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:58,033
talked about in this video about
DNA to mRNA to tRNA to

544
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:02,057
these molecules, this is true
for all of life on our planet,

545
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:05,057
so we all share this
same mechanism.

546
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:09,093
Me and this plant, we share
that common root

547
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:11,033
that we all have DNA.

548
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:14,057
As different as me and that
roach that I might not like to

549
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:18,024
be in the same room, we all
share that same common root of

550
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:21,088
DNA and that all of it codes to
proteins in this exact same

551
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:24,044
way, that there's this
commonality amongst all life.

552
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:25,070
That, to me, is mind blowing.

553
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,097
Then even more mind blowing is
how these very complex shapes

554
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:31,035
are formed by the DNA.

555
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:33,085
And this isn't speculation.

556
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,071
This is observed behavior.

557
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,079
This is a fascinating structure
right here, but it's

558
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,005
just based on 20 amino acid--
you can almost view the amino

559
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:46,050
acid as the LEGOS, and you put
the LEGOS together, and just

560
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:51,089
the chemical interactions form
these fairly impressive

561
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,008
structures right here.

562
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:55,046
So now that we know a little bit
about DNA and how it codes

563
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:58,040
into protein, we can take a
little jump back and talk a

564
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,048
little bit more about how
variation is actually

565
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:04,021
introduced into a population.

566
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,086

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,039


2
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:03,037
What I want to do in this video
is try to understand how

3
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:07,096
two proteins can interact with
each other in conjunction with

4
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:12,021
ATP to actually produce
mechanical motion.

5
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,032
And the reason why I want to
do this-- one, it occurs

6
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,057
outside of muscle cells as well,
but this is really going

7
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:20,002
to be the first video on really
how muscles work.

8
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:23,030
And then we'll talk about how
nerves actually stimulate

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,007
muscles to work.

10
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,057
So it'll all build up
from this video.

11
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:30,000
So what I've done here is I've
copy and pasted two images of

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,048
proteins from Wikipedia.

13
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:34,046
This is myosin.

14
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:37,010
It's actually myosin II because
you actually have two

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,040
strands of the myosin protein.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,014
They're interwound around each
other so you can see it's this

17
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:46,003
very complex looking protein or
enzyme, however you want to

18
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:46,069
talk about it.

19
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,042
I'll tell you why it's called
an enzyme-- because it

20
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:53,003
actually helps react ATP into
ADP and phosphate groups.

21
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,046
So that's why it's
called an ATPase.

22
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:59,014
It's a subclass of the
ATPase enzymes.

23
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:02,053
This right here is actin.

24
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:06,084
What we're going to see in
this video is how myosin

25
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:10,092
essentially uses the ATP to
essentially crawl along.

26
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:13,082
You can almost view it as an
actin rope and that's what

27
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,079
creates mechanical energy.

28
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,048
So let me draw it.

29
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:19,023
I'll actually draw it on
this actin right here.

30
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:23,028
So let's say we have one
of these myosin heads.

31
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:25,073
So when I say a myosin head,
this is one of the myosin

32
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:29,014
heads right here and then it's
connected, it's interwound,

33
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,006
it's woven around.

34
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,062
This is the other one and it
winds around that way.

35
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,090
Now let's just say we're
just dealing with one

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,073
of the myosin heads.

37
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,004
Let's say it's in
this position.

38
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,045
Let me see how well
I can draw it.

39
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:44,037
Let's say it starts off in a
position that looks like that

40
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:48,065
and then this is kind of the
tail part that connects to

41
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,048
some other structural and we'll
talk about that in more

42
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:53,057
detail, but this is my myosin
head right there in its

43
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:56,048
starting position, not
doing anything.

44
00:01:56,048 --> 00:02:01,098
Now, ATP can come along and bond
to this myosin head, this

45
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:05,093
enzyme, this protein,
this ATPase enzyme.

46
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:09,021
So let me draw some ATP.

47
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:12,081
So ATP comes along and bonds
to this guy right here.

48
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,084
Let's say that's the-- and it's
not going to be this big

49
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,093
relative to the protein,
but this is just to

50
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,024
give you the idea.

51
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:24,012
So soon as the ATP binds to its
appropriate site on this

52
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:28,040
enzyme or protein, the enzyme,
it detaches from the actin.

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,052
So let me write this down.

54
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:44,056
So one, ATP binds to myosin
head and as soon as that

55
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:58,038
happens, that causes the myosin
to release actin.

56
00:02:58,038 --> 00:02:59,071
So that's step one.

57
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:03,005
So I start it off with this guy
just touching the actin,

58
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:05,056
the ATP comes, and
it gets released.

59
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:09,056
So in the next step-- so after
that step, it's going to look

60
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,081
something like this--
and I want to draw

61
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,099
it in the same place.

62
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,030
After the next step,
it's going to look

63
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,081
something like this.

64
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,006
It will have released.

65
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:19,090


66
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,015
So now it looks something like
that and you have the ATP

67
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:26,087
attached to it still.

68
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:28,096
I know it might be a little
bit convoluted when I keep

69
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:30,044
writing over the same thing,
but you have the

70
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,061
ATP attached to it.

71
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,031
Now the next step-- the ATP
hydrolizes, the phosphate gets

72
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,043
pulled off of it.

73
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:39,033
This is an ATPase enzyme.

74
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,031
That's what it does.

75
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,056
Let me write that down.

76
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:54,025


77
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:58,066
And what that does, that
releases the energy to cock

78
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:03,003
this myosin protein into kind
of a high energy state.

79
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,037
So let me do step two.

80
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,031
This thing-- it gets
hydrolized.

81
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,025
It releases energy.

82
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:13,050
We know that ATP is the energy
currency of biological

83
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,029
systems. So it releases
energy.

84
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,057
I'm drawing it as a little spark
or explosion, but you

85
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:23,000
can really imagine it's changing
the confirmation of--

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,054
it kind of spring-loads this
protein right here to go into

87
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:29,075
a state so it's ready to
crawl along the myosin.

88
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:36,050
So in step two-- plus energy,
energy and then this-- you can

89
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:44,050
say it cocks the myosin
protein or

90
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,041
enzyme to high energy.

91
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,093
You can imagine it winds the
spring, or loads the spring.

92
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:57,064


93
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:01,081
And confirmation for proteins
just mean shape.

94
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:05,097
So step two-- what happens is
the phosphate group gets--

95
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,082
they're still attached, but
it gets detached from

96
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,094
the rest of the ATP.

97
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,076
So that becomes ADP and that
energy changes the

98
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:16,042
confirmation so that this
protein now goes into a

99
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,023
position that looks like this.

100
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:23,054
So this is where we end up
at the end of step two.

101
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:27,049
Let me make sure
I do it right.

102
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,012
So at the end of step
two, it might look

103
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,037
something like this.

104
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:36,086


105
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,093
So the end of step two,
the protein looks

106
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,056
something like this.

107
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,025
This is in its cocked
position.

108
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,067
It has a lot of energy
right now.

109
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:46,062
It's wound up in
this position.

110
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:49,050
You still have your ADP.

111
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,081
You still have your-- that's
your adenosine and let's say

112
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:56,077
you have your two phosphate
groups on the ADP and you

113
00:05:56,077 --> 00:06:00,056
still have one phosphate
group right there.

114
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:04,049
Now, when that phosphate group
releases-- so let me write

115
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:06,004
this as step three.

116
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,037
Remember, when we started, we
were just sitting here.

117
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:12,018
The ATP binds on step one--
actually, it does definitely

118
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:16,043
bind, at the end of step one,
that causes the myosin protein

119
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,087
to get released.

120
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,006
Then after step one, we
naturally have step two.

121
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,047
The ATP hydrolyzes into
ADP phosphate.

122
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:29,085
That releases energy and that
allows the myosin protein to

123
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:33,023
get cocked into this high energy
position and kind of

124
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:37,062
attach, you can think of
it, to the next rung

125
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,048
of our actin filament.

126
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:42,096
Now we're in a high
energy state.

127
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:47,016


128
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:49,069
In step three, the phosphate
releases.

129
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:57,075


130
00:06:57,075 --> 00:07:01,098
The phosphate is released from
myosin in step three.

131
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:03,017
That's step three right there.

132
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,025
That's a phosphate group
being released.

133
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,031
And what this does is, this
releases that energy of that

134
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,014
cocked position and it causes
this myosin protein

135
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:16,029
to push on the actin.

136
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,073
This is the power stroke, if
you imagine in an engine.

137
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:21,006
This is what's causing the
mechanical movement.

138
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,038
So when the phosphate group is
actually released-- remember,

139
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,047
the original release
is when you take

140
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,043
ATP to ADP in a phosphate.

141
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:30,002
That put it in this
spring-loaded position.

142
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:32,092
When the phosphate releases it,
this releases the spring.

143
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:41,008


144
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:43,043
And what that does is it pushes
on the actin filament.

145
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:49,093


146
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,072
So you could view this
as the power stroke.

147
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,075
We're actually creating
mechanical energy.

148
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:56,012
So depending on which one you
want to view as fixed-- if you

149
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,093
view the actin as fixed,
whatever myosin is attached to

150
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,036
it would move to the left.

151
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:04,052
If you imagine the myosin being
fixed, the actin and

152
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:07,018
whatever it's attached to
would move to the right,

153
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:07,089
either way.

154
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,054
But this is where
we fundamentally

155
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,094
get the muscle action.

156
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:16,029
And then step four-- you
have the ADP released.

157
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:21,017


158
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:25,095
And then we're exactly where
we were before we did step

159
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:29,025
one, except we're just one rung
further to the left on

160
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,088
the actin molecule.

161
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,052
So to me, this is
pretty amazing.

162
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:38,000
We actually are seeing how ATP
energy can be used to-- we're

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,057
going from chemical energy
or bond energy in ATP to

164
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:48,082
mechanical energy.

165
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:53,005


166
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,008
For me, that's amazing because
when I first learned about

167
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:58,063
ATP-- people say, you use ATP to
do everything in your cells

168
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,064
and contract muscles.

169
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:02,035
Well, gee, how do you go from
bond energy to actually

170
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:04,085
contracting things, to actually
doing what we see in

171
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,000
our everyday world as
mechanical energy?

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,038
And this is really where
it all occurs.

173
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:12,013
This is really the core issue
that's going on here.

174
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:14,011
And you have to say, well, gee,
how this thing change

175
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,028
shape and all that?

176
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,032
And you have to remember,
these proteins, based on

177
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:19,024
what's bonded to it and
what's not bonded to

178
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,025
it, they change shape.

179
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,080
And some of those shapes take
more energy to attain, and

180
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,061
then if you do the right things,
that energy can be

181
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,044
released and then it can
push another protein.

182
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:30,091
But I find this just
fascinating.

183
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:34,010
And now we can build up from
this actin and myosin

184
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,092
interactions to understand how
muscles actually work.

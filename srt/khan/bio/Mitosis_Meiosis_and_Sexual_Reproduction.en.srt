1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,031


2
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,056
I touched on this a little bit
in the video on how variation

3
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:05,096
can be introduced into a
population, but I think it's

4
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:08,075
fairly common knowledge that all
of us-- when I talk about

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:11,035
us I'm talking about human
beings, and frankly, most

6
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:14,015
eukaryotic organisms-- we're
the product of sexual

7
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,035
reproduction.

8
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:20,044
So if this is the first cell
that had the potential to

9
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:24,026
become Sal, we know that this
first cell-- let me say this

10
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,019
is the nucleus of that first
cell so I can draw the whole

11
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,035
cell and all that, but let's
just focus on the nucleus.

12
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,082
It has 23 chromosomes.

13
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:32,003
Well, let me put it this way.

14
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:36,028
It has 46 chromosomes, 23 from
my father and 23 from my

15
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:41,000
mother, so that's 1, 2 3, 4, 3
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,003
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23 from my father.

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,000
And then let's say that last
one actually helps to

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,046
determine my gender, or it fully
determines my gender.

19
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,009
That's my Y chromosome.

20
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:56,007
And let's say I had 23
homologous chromosomes, or one

21
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,011
chromosome that kind of was
the homologue for each of

22
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:03,072
these, but I have 23 of them
from my mother, so 1, 2, 3, 4,

23
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:07,081
5-- oh, you get the idea.

24
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,090
I can just draw a bunch of
them, and then have the X

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,048
chromosome that is essentially
one of the gender-determining

26
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,045
chromosomes from my mother.

27
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:18,054
And we learned before that
each of these pairs are

28
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:21,081
homologous chromosomes, that
they essentially code for the

29
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,026
same gene, one from my father
and one from my mother.

30
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:29,098
Now, that first cell that had
the potential to become me, it

31
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:34,003
was a product of fertilization,
of an egg from

32
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:37,006
my mother-- so an egg
from my mother.

33
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,012


34
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:44,023
I'll just draw the whole
egg like that.

35
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:48,029
I'll just focus on the DNA from
now, so my mother's DNA,

36
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,081
it had 23 chromosomes.

37
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,065
So it didn't have pairs,
and this is key.

38
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:58,004
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

39
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:04,090
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, and then 23 was the X

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,031
chromosome.

41
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:10,080
And so it's a combination from
my mother, so this is from my

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,083
mother, and a sperm
from my father.

43
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,091
Let me do that here.

44
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:19,031
And I'll draw the sperm much
larger than it is normally

45
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:19,083
relatively to the egg.

46
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,084
This is kind of the nucleus of
the egg, but let's say that

47
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:27,003
this is the sperm, and it has a
tail that helps it swim, and

48
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:31,066
it has 23 chromosomes.

49
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:36,066
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

50
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:40,037
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then
it has that Y chromosome.

51
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:43,075
Let me do that Y chromosome
in a separate color.

52
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:47,000
Just as an aside, this
unification, this

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,022
fertilization that occurred from
this sperm cell to this

54
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:53,012
egg cell, so it essentially
penetrates into this egg cell

55
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:59,069
and it creates this zygote,
which is a fertilized egg cell

56
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,024
from my mother, and this
contains all DNA from both my

57
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,006
father and my mother.

58
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,093
So this very first cell that
was created from this

59
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:10,069
fertilized egg, this
is called a zygote.

60
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:11,068
It's a product of

61
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,062
fertilization between two gametes.

62
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:16,066


63
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:20,053
So that's a gamete and
this is a gamete.

64
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:24,061


65
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:28,081
Both a sperm cell or an
egg cell, they're

66
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:31,044
both examples of gametes.

67
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,034
Now, the whole reason why I'm
doing this is I want to

68
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:36,015
introduce you-- and I already
introduced this notion to you

69
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,069
when we talked about the
variation of population, that,

70
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,037
look, this has my full
chromosome complement.

71
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:49,099
It has 23 pairs, and each pair
is a pair of homologous

72
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,055
chromosomes.

73
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:53,003
They essentially code for the
same things, one from my

74
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:58,031
mother, one from my father,
and that is 46 individual

75
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:03,081
chromosomes, 23 from my mother,
23 from my father.

76
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:11,037
These gametes, they each have
only 23 chromosomes, or half

77
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:15,075
the number of a full
complement.

78
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,070
Now, everything that I'm talking
about here, the number

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,031
46, or 23 pairs, or 23
individual chromosomes, this

80
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:23,022
is unique to human beings.

81
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,098
If I talked about other species,
they might have 10

82
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,026
chromosomes or they might
have 5 chromosomes.

83
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,026
But one thing that is universal
for all sexually

84
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:35,033
reproducing organisms is that
gametes have half the number

85
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:38,086
of chromosomes as the zygote, or
you can kind of view it as

86
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:41,068
the organism itself, the way we

87
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:43,026
conventionally think about it.

88
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,074
So when people talk about half
the number of chromosomees,

89
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:48,009
they say it has a
haploid number.

90
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,085
And that literally just means
half the number of

91
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,042
chromosomes.

92
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:54,069
It's very easy to memorize,
because haploid starts with

93
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:58,042
the same two letters as half.

94
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:04,000
Haploid number for humans
is 23 chromosomes.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,063
And so, you say, oh, if you say
this is a haploid number,

96
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:08,097
what do you call it when you
have the full complement of

97
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,083
chromosomes?

98
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,029
Well, that's called the
diploid number.

99
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:16,081


100
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,026
And I remember that because
di- often is a prefix

101
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:24,023
associated with having two of
something, and so you have

102
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,048
twice the number
of chromosomes.

103
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:29,081
So this is haploid, this is
diploid number, and this is

104
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:32,031
for humans, right?

105
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,036
For an organism where the
diploid number is N, and

106
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,083
you'll sometimes see this
notation, so I want to make

107
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,088
sure you're comfortable with it,
there's some organism, or

108
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,080
actually any organism.

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,018
If the diploid number is 2N,
then the haploid number is

110
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,087
going to be half of
that, or just N.

111
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:54,074
Now, in the case of humans, the
diploid number is 46, so N

112
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:56,041
is equal to 23.

113
00:05:56,041 --> 00:06:01,007
So a fertilized egg or even just
a regular somatic cell or

114
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:04,088
a body cell will have a diploid
number of chromosome,

115
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:08,039
while a sex cell, and I'll be
a little bit clearer about

116
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,054
that in a second, will have a
haploid number of chromosomes.

117
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,060
So gametes, which are either a
sperm or an egg, those are

118
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,000
both examples of gametes, they
have half the number, they

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,061
merge, and then you get a
zygote, which is that very

120
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:25,074
first cell that had the
potential to turn into me,

121
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,080
that has a diploid number
of chromosomes.

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,082
And I actually want to do a
little bit of a side here,

123
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,044
because it's fascinating.

124
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:33,058
We talk about natural selection,
and we even wonder

125
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:36,006
today to what degree is it
occurring, because our

126
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:40,086
society, it's not as tough of an
environment as the natural

127
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:43,010
world would be where we're being
stalked by predators and

128
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,016
we have to live out in
the wild and find

129
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:46,032
food and all of that.

130
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:51,036
But even this process of
fertilization is an incredibly

131
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:57,077
competitive process, because
this sperm that happened to be

132
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:02,008
the one that kind of won the
race from my father to

133
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:05,048
fertilize my mother's egg, it
was actually the first of

134
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:09,054
roughly 200 million other
sperms. There were 200

135
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,074
million, roughly.

136
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,064
There could've been 200
to 300 million other

137
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,038
sperms in that race.

138
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,086


139
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,080
From the moment we're born,
we're already the product of

140
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,073
an intense competition amongst
these male-- I guess we could

141
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:27,055
call them male gametes, or
amongst these sperm cells.

142
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:30,048
Some of them might have had
weird mutations, that they

143
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,062
didn't know which direction to
swim, they happened to go in

144
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:35,037
the wrong direction, maybe some
of them had weird tails

145
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,007
that didn't allow them to swim
as fast, so you're already on

146
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,094
some level selecting for
fitness within this

147
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,054
environment.

148
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:44,060
So if you had some weird
mutations from the get go in

149
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,068
some of these sperm cells, it
would have been less likely,

150
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,031
especially if they affected
their ability to kind of swim,

151
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,007
it would've been less likely
that they would have been the

152
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,061
ones to win this race.

153
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:57,072
So already, you are the product
of a race of 280

154
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:00,060
million organisms, if you
consider each of these sperm

155
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,018
cells an organism, and you are
the product of that winning

156
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:04,093
combination.

157
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:07,045
So, you know, sometimes we
feel lost on this planet.

158
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:10,061
We're one of 6 billion people
and all that, or just a

159
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:17,007
number, but we already are the
product of a pretty intense

160
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,025
accomplishment.

161
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:23,056
But now with some of this
vocabulary thrown out of the

162
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:26,044
way, let's talk a little bit
about zygotes and how do

163
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:29,087
zygotes turn into people, and
then how do those people

164
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:33,001
essentially produce gametes,
which then can fertilize other

165
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,092
people's gametes to
form more zygotes.

166
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:41,044
So the general idea: So that
very first cell that was

167
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:45,040
essentially my mom's egg
fertilized by a sperm cell

168
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,050
from my father, that was a
zygote, and as soon as it's

169
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,039
successfully fertilized, it has
2N, or it has the diploid

170
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,042
number of chromosomes in the
case of humans, which I

171
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,000
believe I am one of them.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,002
I have 46 chromosomes.

173
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:06,091
And then this cell right here
begins to split and divide

174
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,029
over and over and over again.

175
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,061
We'll do a whole series of
videos on the actual mechanics

176
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:16,025
of that, but it splits by a
mechanism called mitosis.

177
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:19,073
And mitosis literally is just
a cell splitting to form

178
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:21,037
copies of itself.

179
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:25,071
So it just starts splitting into
two more cells that are--

180
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,090
and actually, let me do it this
way, just because the

181
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,045
actual way it works is right
when a cell is split, the

182
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:35,064
cells that it splits into aren't
that much larger than

183
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,066
the original one.

184
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:40,037
But now each of these have 2N
chromosomes, or 46 in the case

185
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,085
of humans, and you keep
splitting, and it happens over

186
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,001
and over and over again.

187
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:48,080
So eventually-- well, let
me just do it this way.

188
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,014
This keeps splitting, and then
you have-- and I'll go into

189
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:56,042
the words for some of these
initial collections of cell,

190
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,044
but I won't go into
that right now.

191
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:02,035
2N, all of these are original
copies from a genetic point of

192
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,022
view of that original cell.

193
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:07,086
And then eventually, they start
to really-- I start to

194
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:10,026
have tons of them.

195
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:15,066
There's just a gazillion of them
that are all duplicates

196
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:19,024
of the cell, and they all
contain the 2N number of

197
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,089
chromosomes, the diploid
number of chromosomes.

198
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,089
They all contain all of my
genetic material, but based on

199
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,032
how they relate to each other
and what they see around them,

200
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:31,020
they start differentiating.

201
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,011
So all of these have 2N number,

202
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:33,089
so they're all diploid.

203
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,083
And mitosis-- this is the
process the whole time-- is

204
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:40,020
these divide one cell into two
cells and those two cells into

205
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,061
four cells and keep going.

206
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:43,061
And then these begin
to differentiate.

207
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:46,084
Maybe these cells eventually
differentiate into things

208
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:48,065
that'll turn to my brain.

209
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,042
These cells right here
differentiate into things

210
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,044
that'll turn into my heart.

211
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,040
These cells here differentiate
into things that will turn

212
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,057
into my lungs and so
forth and so on.

213
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:03,053
And eventually, you
get a human being.

214
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,069
But it doesn't have to
be a human being.

215
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,045
It could be whatever species we
happen to be talking about.

216
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,062
So let me draw the
human being.

217
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:14,082
So I'll draw my best shot at an
outline of a human being.

218
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:17,086


219
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:20,065
Now, we're talking about
gazillions of cells.

220
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:25,066
You have your human being, and
I'll just draw a very simple

221
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:28,016
diagram, outline of
a human being.

222
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:32,008


223
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,012
When I was in high school, I was
a class artist, so I don't

224
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,001
want to make this representative
of my true

225
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,022
artistic ability.

226
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:43,021
I'm doing this here just to
kind of give you an idea.

227
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:46,059
But anyway, eventually, you keep
dividing these cells and

228
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,003
you end up with a human being,
and this human being, you

229
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:51,057
know, you wouldn't even notice
the cells on this scale.

230
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:55,037
Now, most of these cells of this
human being, if this is

231
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:59,042
me or you, these are all the
product of mitosis that

232
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,016
started off with that zygote,
and it just kept dividing and

233
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:05,001
dividing and dividing
into mitosis.

234
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,045
But it differentiated.

235
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:09,047
I said some of them will
turn into brain cells.

236
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,075
Some of them will turn
into heart cells.

237
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,064
The whole process of
differentiation is actually

238
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,071
fascinating, and we'll talk a
lot more about that when we

239
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:20,023
talk about stem cells, embryonic
stem cells, and

240
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:22,096
maybe we'll even talk about
the debate of it.

241
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:25,016
But the question is,
well, how do I then

242
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,046
produce those gametes?

243
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,024
How do I produce those things
that eventually, if I'm going

244
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:32,071
to reproduce, turn into
these kind of

245
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,035
haploid number of cells?

246
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:36,069
And that's what happens
in your sexual organs.

247
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:41,030
So in a male, you have some germ
cells, so some of these

248
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,098
cells turn into germ cells.

249
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:47,063
And the germ cells exist
as part of your

250
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,021
reproductive organs.

251
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,099
So let's say those are
the germ cells.

252
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:54,045
In a male, they would be
part of the gonads, so

253
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,003
they would be there.

254
00:12:56,003 --> 00:13:00,084
In a female, they would be
involved in the ovaries.

255
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:04,026
And these germ cells, they're
the product of mitosis.

256
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,072
So let me draw a germ cell.

257
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:16,069
So a germ cell is the product of
mitosis, so it still has 2N

258
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:22,098
number of chromosomes, so it
still is a diploid cell or has

259
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,099
a diploid number.

260
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:26,096
But what's special about a
germ cell is it has the

261
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:32,029
potential, one, it can either
continue to do mitosis and

262
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,069
produce more germ cells that
are identical to it, so it

263
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,087
could produce two germ cells
that are identical to it, or

264
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,039
it can undergo meiosis.

265
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:48,041


266
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,033
And meiosis is essentially what
a germ cell undergoes to

267
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,094
produce gametes.

268
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:56,084
And so if this germ cell
undergoes meiosis, and I'll do

269
00:13:56,084 --> 00:14:00,047
a whole video on the mechanics
of it, instead of two cells,

270
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:05,080
it'll actually produce four
cells that each have half the

271
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,046
number of chromosomes in them,
so these cells are haploid.

272
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:15,092
In the case of a male, these
would be sperm cells.

273
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:17,069
This would be sperm.

274
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:24,055
In the case of a female, these
would be ova, sperm or ova,

275
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:26,002
and these are the gametes.

276
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:29,015
So it's an interesting thing to
talk about, because in the

277
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:32,009
last several videos, I talked a
lot about mutations and what

278
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,025
does that do to a species, but
think about what happens.

279
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:39,000
If I have a mutation in some
cell here, some somatic cell,

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,028
some body cell, somatic cell,
will that mutation or can that

281
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:48,049
mutation in any way affect
what's going to

282
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,075
happen to my kids?

283
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:52,015
Will that mutation be carried
on to my kids?

284
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, no.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,075
Because in no way will what goes
on in this cell affect

286
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:00,065
what I actually pass on
eventually in the sperm cells.

287
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,085
It'll just be a random
mutation.

288
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:04,057
It could affect my ability
to reproduce.

289
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:09,075
For example, it could be-- God
forbid, it could be some type

290
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,099
of cancer or something that,
especially if you contract it

291
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:16,008
at a young age, it might be some
type of terminal form so

292
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,096
that might affect your ability
to reproduce, but it will not

293
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:24,012
affect the actual DNA that you
pass on to your offspring.

294
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:27,072
So if you have some really bad
mutation here, it could affect

295
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:31,030
how you live or it could turn
cancerous and start

296
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,003
reproducing, but it will not
affect what you pass on to

297
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:38,027
your children.

298
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:41,063
The traits that will be passed
on or the changes that will be

299
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:45,020
passed on are those that occur
in the germ cells.

300
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,000
So if you have mutations in your
germ cells, or during the

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,026
process of meiosis, you have
essentially recombination of

302
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:56,012
DNA because of crossovers, and
we saw that in the variation

303
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:59,050
video, then that will introduce
new forms or new

304
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,035
variants inside that could be
passed on to your children.

305
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,097
And I really want to make that
point there, because we talk

306
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,051
about mutations, but there's
different types of mutations.

307
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,058
There's some mutations that
won't be passed on to your

308
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:12,002
children, and those are the
ones that occur in your

309
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,012
somatic cells.

310
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,016
Maybe some of them do nothing
so then it really doesn't

311
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,017
affect your overall function,
but in the mutations that

312
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:24,035
either occur in your germ cells
or the recombination or

313
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:26,083
the variation that is introduced
during meiosis,

314
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,087
that will be passed on
to your children.

315
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,028
But even there I want
to be careful.

316
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:33,070
Because remember, this is
a severe competition.

317
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,026
So out of all of the-- let's say
there's 280 million sperm

318
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:42,051
cells that at one time are being
competitive for an egg,

319
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:46,071
it's possible that some of
them have mutations.

320
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,036
In order for one of those
mutations-- let me do the

321
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:51,013
mutations in different colors.

322
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,012
That's a purple mutation.

323
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,034
That's a blue mutation.

324
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:57,039
But in order for that mutation
to truly be passed on to my

325
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,052
offspring, the sperm containing
the mutation is the

326
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,042
one that has to win the race.

327
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:06,053
So already you have a selection
going on at kind of

328
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:11,024
this sexual reproduction level
where you're selecting for

329
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,080
things that are at least good
enough-- I mean, to some

330
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,091
degree, the sperm has to be
good enough to win this is

331
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:19,093
incredibly, incredibly
competitive race.

332
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,080
So that mutation that somehow
made the sperm deformed or

333
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,020
didn't allow it to swim or made
it behave in some weird

334
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,067
way, it's very unlikely that
that mutation would go on to

335
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:31,081
be the one or that cell would go
on to be the one that would

336
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:34,011
successfully fertilize an egg.

337
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,081
So anyway, I wanted to introduce
you to these ideas.

338
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,057
The main idea is really
some of the

339
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,008
vocabulary: haploid, diploid.

340
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,010
It's very confusing when you
first learn it, but it

341
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,095
literally just means half the
normal group of chromosomes.

342
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:51,004
And in the case of humans,
that would be 23.

343
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:55,035
And the cells that have a
haploid number of chromosomes

344
00:17:55,035 --> 00:18:00,013
are our gametes, which are sperm
cells for men, and ova,

345
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,083
or egg cells for women.

346
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,049
But everything else in our
body, all of our somatic

347
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,050
cells, are diploid, which means
that the full complement

348
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,029
of chromosomes, they all
have a copy of our DNA.

349
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:12,046
And that's why DNA testing is so
interesting because you can

350
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:14,084
get any cell from someone
anywhere, and you have their

351
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,041
full complement of DNA.

352
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,011
You have all of the information
that describes

353
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,085
them genetically.

354
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:23,052
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

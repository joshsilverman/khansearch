1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,051


2
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,012
In the last video on the
nephron, we talked about the

3
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:08,068
different parts of the nephron
and what, I guess, molecules

4
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:11,075
are reabsorbed by the body
and the different parts.

5
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:15,089
If you remember, in the proximal
convoluted tubule, we

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,025
talked about maybe glucose and
amino acids and sodium being

7
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:21,023
reabsorbed.

8
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:24,050
We talked about the ascending
part of the loop of Henle.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,010
We talked about salts, so that
sodium, potassium, chlorine

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,046
being reabsorbed.

11
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:33,029
In the distal convoluted
tubule, it was

12
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,021
calcium, other things.

13
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:38,085
But at least in my mind, when I
first learned it, I said how

14
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,057
does that happen?

15
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:42,075
How do we actively pump out
these things, especially

16
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,036
against their own concentration
gradients?

17
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,017
What I want to do in this video
is get a little bit more

18
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:50,077
depth on exactly what's
happening on the borders of

19
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:54,000
these tubules to actually
allow these ions to be

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,052
selectively transported out of
the lumen or the inside of

21
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,075
these tubes or to be

22
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:05,040
reabsorbed out of the filtrate.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,056
The mechanism's actually
reasonably similar in the

24
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,050
different parts of the nephron,
but let's look at

25
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,093
each of the parts, because
they're each reabsorbing

26
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:14,017
different types of molecules.

27
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:15,079
And I won't go through all of
the molecules, but I'll just

28
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,089
give you a sense of things.

29
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:20,031
Let's start with the proximal
tubule right here.

30
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:25,051
So let's say if we were to zoom
in right over on that

31
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:30,026
part-- so let me draw the
inside of the nephron.

32
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:31,078
The inside of the nephron
maybe looks

33
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,037
something like this.

34
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,045
So this the inside.

35
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:39,040
This is where our filtrate
is right here.

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,068
Actually, let me draw
it a little bit

37
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,089
different than that.

38
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:46,010
So the inside, I'm going to draw
it like this because the

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,084
proximal tubule has these little
things that stick out,

40
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:53,034
sometimes referred to
as a brush border.

41
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:57,029
So this inside right here,
this is our lumen.

42
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:01,062


43
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:05,009
That is where the filtrate is.

44
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,040
The glomerular filtrate is
coming in this direction.

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,081


46
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:14,081
This is, you can imagine, the
inside of the nephron.

47
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:18,028
And then the border of
the tubule is made up

48
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:19,033
by a bunch of cells.

49
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:22,078
So maybe this is one cell right
here, this is another

50
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:25,075
cell right here, that's
another cell.

51
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:26,086
Obviously, this is
a cross-section.

52
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:28,015
It would be actually
more of a cylinder.

53
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,040
It would go around like that.

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,087
This is to give an idea.

55
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:32,040
That's another cell
right there.

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,081
And maybe this is their basal
side right there.

57
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,091
And when we say basal, we can
imagine that's kind of the

58
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,011
base of the cell.

59
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:44,090
Those are good words to
know, fancy words.

60
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,096
So the side of the cells that
are facing the lumen, or kind

61
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:51,093
of facing the inside of our
tubule, this is called the

62
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,018
apical side.

63
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:57,003


64
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,041
And then this side is normally
referred to the basal lateral

65
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,062
side, or this membrane, if you
view this as a membrane, this

66
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:08,044
would be the basolateral
membrane.

67
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:11,080
This is true regardless of what
part of the nephron we're

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,003
in, whether the proximal,
whether the loop of Henle, or

69
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,002
whether we're in the
distal part.

70
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:19,003
What we have here, and on the
other sides of these cells,

71
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,090
we'll have our peritubular
capillaries.

72
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,084
That's another fancy word.

73
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:26,062
So our peritubular capillaries
will look something like this.

74
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:28,022
They're actually
cells as well.

75
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:31,037


76
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:33,002
Actually, instead of drawing the
cells, I'll just draw it

77
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:36,034
as kind of the tube of-- I'll
just draw it like this.

78
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,093
They're porous.

79
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:40,074
So this is actually blood
flow right here.

80
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,091
This is blood right here.

81
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:44,028
This is blood right here.

82
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:46,087
I'm not going to do too much
detail on the actual cells of

83
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,093
the capillary walls.

84
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,078
I really want to give you the
idea of how things are

85
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,040
transported out of the lumen,
how they're selectively

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,065
reabsorbed.

87
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,041


88
00:03:56,041 --> 00:04:03,044
So this is the peritubular
capillary.

89
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,097
And once again, fancy
word, but peri means

90
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:07,046
around, like perimeter.

91
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,093
So it's around the tubes.

92
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,047
These capillaries go
around the tubes.

93
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:12,043
If I were overlay it on this
picture, we have these

94
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,013
capillaries that are going
all around the tubes.

95
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,081
So when things get secreted
or reabsorbed out of the

96
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:21,008
nephrons, they're going into
those capillaries.

97
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:24,062
So this is our proximal
convoluted

98
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,097
membrane right here.

99
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:28,054
Let's think about what happens
with the glucose.

100
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:33,075
So what happens is we actually
have sodium-potassium pumps on

101
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:37,051
the basolateral side
of these cells.

102
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,004
So this is sodium-potassium
pumps.

103
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:41,037
I'll just draw one right here.

104
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,073
You might want to watch
the video on

105
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,060
sodium-potassium pumps.

106
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,025
I have a whole video on it.

107
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:51,088
But the idea here is that
sodium, maybe I'll draw as

108
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:55,081
plus particles right there,
they'll attach on the inside

109
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:58,024
right here, ATP will
come along.

110
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:02,014
When ATP attaches to the right
part of this protein, it'll

111
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:05,087
change its shape, its
conformation, and then the

112
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:09,031
protein will essentially close
on this side and open on that

113
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:14,068
side, and then when it's in that
conformation, the sodium

114
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:18,000
doesn't want to bond as much to
the protein and it will go

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,008
outside or it'll cross the
basolateral membrane and

116
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:24,013
eventually make its way
into the blood.

117
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:27,036
And then on the other side, it's
a sodium-potassium pump.

118
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,081
When it's in this kind of open
configuration-- I'll draw it

119
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:36,077
over here; I have a whole video
on this-- at that point,

120
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:39,031
potassium likes to bond to it.

121
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:42,007
So potassium likes
to bond to it.

122
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,070
Maybe it bonds to
it over here.

123
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,057
This is a gross
oversimplification.

124
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:48,000
That causes the protein to
change its conformation.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,060
It doesn't require ATP at that
point, and it goes back to

126
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,062
this conformation, and then the
potassium doesn't want to

127
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:56,087
bond anymore, and then it gets
released, because the protein

128
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:57,086
is now a different shape.

129
00:05:57,086 --> 00:06:00,086
So the general idea:
Sodium bonds.

130
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:02,008
ATP bonds.

131
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:05,049
The ATP gets its phosphate
popped off of it.

132
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,082
That changes the shape of
the protein to this.

133
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:10,091
Now the sodium wants to get
released, and now potassium

134
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,087
wants to join.

135
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,037
When potassium joins, we get
to our original one.

136
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:18,031
The end product of this is
we're having sodium being

137
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:21,057
pumped out of the cell and we're
having potassium being

138
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:24,010
pumped into the cell, and this
is active transport.

139
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,038


140
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,019
Why is it active transport?

141
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,016
Because we're using ATP to
drive sodium against its

142
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:36,099
concentration gradient to keep
pumping the sodium out of the

143
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,002
cell, and then potassium kind of
comes in, you could almost

144
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:40,092
imagine, passively.

145
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,094
It doesn't require ATP.

146
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:46,085
And that's why this is often
called a sodium-potassium

147
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:51,062
ATPase, which means it's a
protein or an enzyme that

148
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,051
breaks ATP.

149
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:55,007
But it breaks ATP, it uses
that energy to change its

150
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:58,031
shape to pump sodium out
and potassium in.

151
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,051
Well, anyway, this is all a
review of what we learned in

152
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:03,056
those videos, but how does that
help us, for example, get

153
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,001
glucose out of our lumen?

154
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:10,037
Well, what we have over here
is we have other proteins.

155
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:12,025
I'll just do the example
of glucose.

156
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:15,075
Let's say we have
a protein here.

157
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,027
There's a very general
term for this.

158
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:19,062
It's a cotransporter
or a symporter.

159
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:26,052


160
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:31,011
Symporter means it transfers two
types of molecules in the

161
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:31,079
same direction.

162
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,057
Cotransporter means one molecule
wants to go through

163
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:36,085
because of its concentration
gradient and the other

164
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:39,070
molecule kind of goes
along for the ride.

165
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,026
So you can imagine, we're
actively pumping out sodium.

166
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:46,045
So if we're actively pumping
out sodium over here on the

167
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,088
basolateral side, then we're
going to have a low sodium

168
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,013
concentration here.

169
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,055


170
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,092
The more we pump out, the lower
this is, and eventually

171
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,049
it's going to be lower
than the sodium

172
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,012
concentration in the lumen.

173
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,014
So the sodium concentration
gradient, if there was no

174
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:06,094
membrane here, sodium would want
to go across this to kind

175
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,060
of make up for all of the
lost sodiums over here.

176
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,018
Sodium would want to cross that
if there was no barrier.

177
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,099
These cells here take advantage
of sodium wanting to

178
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,043
move down its concentration
gradient, which is happening

179
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:20,099
because of this active transport
over here, but it

180
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,093
uses that energy of sodium going
down its concentration

181
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:30,056
gradient to actually also
transport, in this case, maybe

182
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,013
some glucose.

183
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,005
So if you had to visualize it,
you could imagine a protein

184
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:37,015
that's on this apical
membrane right here.

185
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:41,089


186
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,025
Maybe it looks something
like this.

187
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,077
This is to get some type
of visualization.

188
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:50,009
Maybe you have more sodium on
this side than you have on

189
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:53,035
this side, so sodium is more
likely to bond here.

190
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:57,012
Maybe glucose will bond here.

191
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,095
This is just a simplification,
but when they bond, this

192
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:05,022
protein is going to change its
shape to look something more

193
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:10,020
like this when they bond, and
now the sodium is going to be

194
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,062
here and the glucose is
going to be here.

195
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:15,068
We're essentially on the inside
of the cell now, and in

196
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,019
this conformation, they don't
want to bond as much to the

197
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,099
amino acids or whatever else
is in the protein, and then

198
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,001
they get released.

199
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,036
And when they get released, then
the protein will change

200
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:27,019
its shape back to this right
here and we can do this cycle

201
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:27,097
over again.

202
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:31,094
But this is all stipulated on
the idea that there's more

203
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:35,025
sodium over here to bump into
this point to make this

204
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,019
reaction happen.

205
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,025
So sodium's going to go down in
its concentration gradient.

206
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,066
It's taking glucose
for the ride.

207
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,001
And so essentially glucose
concentration will go up high

208
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,050
here, and then if we make this
porous to glucose so glucose

209
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,030
can go through, then glucose
will eventually, if this gets

210
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,025
high enough, it'll just go
down its concentration

211
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,000
gradient eventually
into the blood.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,051
And this same exact process is
happening, maybe not exactly

213
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,024
with glucose, but throughout
the entire nephron.

214
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:04,038
If we go to the loop of Henle,
if we go to the ascending part

215
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,017
right here, where we're trying
to get the salts out of the

216
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,087
picture, same idea.

217
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:12,048


218
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:15,065
So let's say that that right
there is the lumen.

219
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:22,050
This is a cell that makes up
the wall of the lumen.

220
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,050
We're in the loop of Henle
now and you have a

221
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,033
sodium-potassium
pump out here.

222
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:31,023
You have sodium being
pumped out.

223
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:34,012
You have potassium gets pumped
in, but actually, potassium

224
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,089
channels are leaky, so potassium
can often make its

225
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,055
way back out in either
direction.

226
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,084
So what's happening to

227
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:42,038
potassium isn't that important.

228
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,073
But so sodium concentration
becomes low here.

229
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:51,051
So what we have are symporters
over here, just like we had

230
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,021
with glucose, but in this case,
sodium wants to enter

231
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,024
just as the case with glucose,
but here we're trying to

232
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,095
transport chlorine and
potassium ions.

233
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,067
So that's what we're
going to join.

234
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,051
That's what's going to take
advantage of sodium's

235
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,078
concentration gradient.

236
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,024
We're going to have potassium
and we're going to have

237
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,066
chlorine ions.

238
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,092
And actually, this symporter
right here, it's called the

239
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:16,015
sodium-potassium-chlorine
cotransporter, and it's

240
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:19,001
actually the second variation
that you actually get in the

241
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,025
ascending loop of Henle.

242
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,037
So eventually, you're going to
end up with a lot of chlorine

243
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:25,026
here-- actually, potassium from
both directions-- but as

244
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:27,040
long as this is porous
to chlorine, if this

245
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,029
concentration gets high enough,
the chlorine is going

246
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,059
to make its way out and help
make the medulla that much

247
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,046
saltier along with the sodium.

248
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,024
Same thing in the distal
convoluted tubule.

249
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:39,044
There, calcium.

250
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,075
It's a little bit different.

251
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:46,032
So if we're in the distal
convoluted tubule, these kind

252
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:48,069
of villi, these things that
stick out-- this is only in

253
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:53,059
the proximal convoluted tubule,
those brush borders.

254
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:56,025
But over there-- and just so
you know, this idea where

255
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,090
we're using a concentration
gradient that's driven by some

256
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,012
type of active transport to
transport other things, this

257
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,022
is called secondary
active transport.

258
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:11,027


259
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:12,019
That's nice to know.

260
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:15,087
And then just finishing up at
the distal convoluted tubule.

261
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,055
So this was the lumen.

262
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:20,012
Let's say that this is the lumen
right here, so we have

263
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,086
cells on either side of that.

264
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:23,034
I think you get the
general idea.

265
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,033
The distal's a little bit
different so let's say this is

266
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:28,057
a cell, and let's say that
this is a peritubular

267
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,039
capillary right here.

268
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,042
This is our blood.

269
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,007
What we have here is
once again, we're

270
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:38,039
pumping sodium out.

271
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,091
Sodium-potassium pumps.

272
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,086
I have a whole video on that,
and that pumps potassium in,

273
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:46,087
so you end up with a lot
of sodiums over here.

274
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,064
The apical membrane that
faces the lumen,

275
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:51,087
it's porous to calcium.

276
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:53,034
Whatever the concentration
of calcium here,

277
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,059
it's going to be here.

278
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:56,090
So maybe you have calcium.

279
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,003
These are calcium ions just
like that floating around.

280
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:04,001
And right here, what you
have is an antiporter.

281
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,063
So our concentration in the
blood of sodium is going to be

282
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:09,014
higher because we keep
pumping it out.

283
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:12,038
And so sodium, if you let it
go down its concentration

284
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,007
gradient, it would go back in.

285
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:18,049
And so maybe right here you have
some sodium going down,

286
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:21,083
its concentration gradient going
back in, and then when

287
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,012
that goes in, that you can
almost imagine it's some type

288
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:28,053
of a rotating door, it makes
the calcium go out.

289
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,075
You can try to visualize it
yourself how a protein would

290
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,025
actually do that.

291
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,070
I kind of imagine a
revolving door.

292
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,039
The sodium makes the
door revolve.

293
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,096
The calcium is at the other
part of the door and

294
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,033
it gets spit out.

295
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,011
So this is called an antiporter
because they're

296
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:43,085
going in different directions,
but once again, it's secondary

297
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:46,039
active transport, because the
only way that this could work

298
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,036
is if we have active transport
using ATP of the sodium out of

299
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:53,065
the basolateral membrane in
every one of these cases.

300
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,059
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.

301
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:58,037
It's more detailed than you
normally get on how the

302
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,099
nephron is actually pumping
things out of the lumen into

303
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,094
the peritubular capillaries, but
for me, it made things a

304
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,001
lot more concrete.

305
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,095
It helps me really kind of
internalize what the

306
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:12,020
nephron is up to.

307
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,033

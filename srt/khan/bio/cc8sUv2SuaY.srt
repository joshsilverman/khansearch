1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,018
What I want to do in this video
is talk a little bit

2
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:05,050
about the kidney-- and this is
a big picture of a kidney--

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,019
and to talk about how it
operates at its-- I guess you

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,050
could call it its smallest
functional level and that's

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,041
the nephron.

6
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:16,069
So we're going to talk about
the kidney and the nephron.

7
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:18,078
And I think you might already
know the kidney.

8
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:19,067
We have two of them.

9
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:23,026
They're the organ that, I guess,
is most famous for

10
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:27,085
producing or allowing
us to excrete waste.

11
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:32,022
But part of that process, it
also helps us maintain our

12
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:36,040
water, the correct level, and
actually the amount of salts

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
or electrolytes we have and our
blood pressure, but I'll

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,086
just say maintain water.

15
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:42,096
And it also produces hormones
and things, and I'm not going

16
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:45,018
to go into a lot of detail
on that right now.

17
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:48,057
I really just want to focus on
these first two to kind of

18
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:52,021
just understand the overview
function of the kidney.

19
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,013
And most of us have
two of these.

20
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,047
They're kind of closer to our
back on either sides of our

21
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,021
spine behind our liver.

22
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:02,046
And this is a zoomed-in
version of it.

23
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,023
If you're watching this in full
screen, it's not going to

24
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:07,015
be as big as this picture is,
but we've sliced it so we can

25
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:10,098
see what's going on
inside the kidney.

26
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:15,012
Just to understand the different
parts here, just

27
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,065
because it will actually be
significant when we start

28
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:20,051
talking about the functional
units or the nephron within

29
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:24,093
the kidney, this area right here
from here to here, this

30
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:28,090
is called the renal cortex.

31
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,054
Whenever we talk about something
with the kidney, if

32
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:34,010
you see a renal anything, that's
actually referring to

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,057
the kidney.

34
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,079
So this right here is
a renal cortex, that

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,023
outer part right there.

36
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:44,037
And then this area right here,
this is the renal medulla.

37
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,048
And medulla comes from middle.

38
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:49,004
So you can almost view it as
the middle of the kidney.

39
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:52,040


40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,068
Besides just understanding these
words, we're going to

41
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:58,034
see that they actually play a
very important role in this

42
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,071
actual filtration or this
excretion of waste and this

43
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:05,073
ability to not dump too much
water or excrete too much

44
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:09,002
water when we're trying to
filter out our blood.

45
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:11,071
So I've said before, and you
might have heard it already

46
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,033
from other lectures or from
other teachers, that the

47
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,049
functional unit of the kidney
is the nephron.

48
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:22,050


49
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,003
And the reason why it's called
a functional unit-- I'll put

50
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,028
it in quotes-- is because that's
the level at which

51
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,025
these two things
are happening.

52
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,097
The two major functions of the
kidney: the waste excretion

53
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:36,058
and the maintenance
of the water level

54
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:37,072
in our blood system.

55
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:41,072
So just to get an idea of how a
nephron fits in within this

56
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:45,084
picture of a kidney-- I got this
picture from Wikipedia.

57
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:48,041
The artist tried to draw a
couple of nephrons over here.

58
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,062
So a nephron will look something
like this, and it

59
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:53,068
dips down into the medulla, and
then it goes back into the

60
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:56,063
cortex, and then it dumps into
collecting ducts, and

61
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:59,062
essentially the fluid will end
up in the ureters right here

62
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:02,096
and end up in our urinary
bladder that we can later

63
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,087
excrete when we find
a suitable time.

64
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,077
But that's about-- I guess
you can imagine

65
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:10,078
the length of a nephron.

66
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:13,003
This is where it starts and
then it dips down again.

67
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,084
So multiple nephrons are going
to keep doing that, but

68
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,084
they're super thin.

69
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:18,013
These tubes or these tubules,
maybe I should

70
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:20,080
say, are super thin.

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,018
Your average kidney will contain
on the order of one

72
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,043
million nephrons.

73
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:31,031


74
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,046
You can't really say, my
nephrons are microscopic.

75
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:39,038
They kind of have a-- at least
their length when they dip

76
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,087
down, you can say, I can
see that distance.

77
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:45,050
You can still jam a lot of them
inside of one kidney.

78
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,058
With that said, let's actually
figure out how a nephron

79
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:52,087
filters the blood and actually
makes sure that not too much

80
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:56,053
water or not too much of the
good stuff in our blood ends

81
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:58,033
up the urine.

82
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:04,006
So let me draw here a nephron.

83
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:07,019
So I'm going to start
like this.

84
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,084
We'll start with
the blood flow.

85
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:13,047
So the blood's going to come
in an arterial-- that's an

86
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,078
arterial capillary,
you could say.

87
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,058
So it's going to come
in like that.

88
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:21,081
This is actually called
the afferent arterial.

89
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:23,023
You don't have to know
the names, but you

90
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,048
might see that sometime.

91
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:26,067


92
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,017
Blood is coming in.

93
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:32,006
Then it goes into this
big windy place.

94
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,081
It really winds around
like that.

95
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,006
This is called the glomerulus.

96
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:43,049


97
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,087
And then it leaves via the
efferent arterial.

98
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:57,010


99
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,061
Efferent just means away
from the center.

100
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:02,075
Afferent towards, efferent
away from the center.

101
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,033
And I'll talk about it more
in the future, but it's

102
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,082
interesting that we're
still dealing with an

103
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,004
artery at this point.

104
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:08,076
It's still oxygenated blood.

105
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:12,025
Normally, when we leave a
capillary system like the

106
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,094
glomerulus right there, we're
normally dealing with the

107
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:18,064
venous system, but here we're
still an arterial system.

108
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:21,027
And it's probably because
arterial systems have higher

109
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:22,075
blood pressure, and what we
need to do is we need to

110
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:28,073
squeeze fluid and stuff that's
dissolved in the fluid out of

111
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,097
the blood and in the glomerulus
right here.

112
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:35,042
So this glomerulus is very
porous and it's surrounded by

113
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,045
other cells.

114
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,070
This is kind of a
cross-section.

115
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,047


116
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:49,019
It's surrounded like that by
this structure, and these are

117
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,035
cells here so you can imagine
these are all cells over here.

118
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,098
And, of course, the actual
capillaries have cells that

119
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:58,095
line them so there
are cells here.

120
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:01,013
So when I draw these lines,
these lines are actually made

121
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,042
up of little cells.

122
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,054
What happens is the
blood comes in

123
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:05,089
at really high pressure.

124
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,095
This is very porous.

125
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:10,041
These cells out here, they're
called podocytes.

126
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,087
They're a little bit more
selective in what gets

127
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,062
filtered out, and essentially
about a fifth of the fluid

128
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:20,063
that's coming in ends up going
into this space right here

129
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:22,055
that's called the
Bowman's space.

130
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,068
Well, actually, this whole
thing is called

131
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,093
the Bowman's capsule.

132
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,026


133
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,064
It's a sphere with an opening in
here that the capillary can

134
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:34,005
kind of wind around in, and the
space right here, this is

135
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:36,088
the Bowman's space.

136
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:41,026
It's the space inside the
Bowman's capsule, and the

137
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,014
whole thing has cells.

138
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:44,019
All these structures are
obviously made-- or maybe not

139
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,082
so obviously-- they're
made up of cells.

140
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,073
And so we end up having
filtrate in it.

141
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:53,018
Filtrate is just the stuff
that gets squeezed out.

142
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:56,037
We can't call it urine just yet
because there's a lot of

143
00:06:56,037 --> 00:07:01,072
steps that have to occur for
it to earn the name urine.

144
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:04,039
So it's only filtrate right now,
and essentially what get

145
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,022
squeezed out, I said it's about
a fifth of the fluid,

146
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:10,044
and things that are easily
dissolved in fluid, so small

147
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:16,043
ions, sodium, maybe some small
molecules like glucose, maybe

148
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:19,056
some amino acids.

149
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,008
There are tons of stuff
in here, but this is

150
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,007
just to give an idea.

151
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,037
The things that do not get
filtered are things like red

152
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:31,033
blood cells or larger molecules,
larger proteins.

153
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,050
They will not get filtered.

154
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,069
It's mainly the micromolecules
that'll get filtered, that'll

155
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:40,091
be part of this filtrate
that shows up here

156
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,038
in the Bowman space.

157
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,011
Now, the rest of what the
nephron does, the Bowman's

158
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,095
capsule is kind of the beginning
of the nephron, and

159
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:51,027
just to get an idea of our big
picture of our kidney, let's

160
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:54,075
say we're near an arterial.

161
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,098
This is a Bowman's capsule
right here.

162
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,007
It looks something like that,
and the whole nephron is going

163
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,057
to be convoluted like this.

164
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:03,014
It's going to dip down into
the medulla, and then come

165
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:06,022
back, and then it's going to
eventually dump into a

166
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,098
collecting duct, and I'll
talk more about that.

167
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:12,025
So what I've drawn just here,
this is a zoomed-in version of

168
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,066
that part right there.

169
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,025
Now what I want to do is zoom
out a little bit because I'm

170
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:17,055
going to run out of space.

171
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,029
So let me zoom out.

172
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,022
So we had our arterial go in.

173
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:26,051
It gets all bunched in the
glomerulus, and then most of

174
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:30,016
the blood leaves, but
one-fifth of it gets

175
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:33,038
essentially filtered in to
the Bowman's capsule.

176
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,077
That's the Bowman's capsule
right there.

177
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:36,045
I've just zoomed out
a little bit.

178
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:39,052
So we have our filtrate here.

179
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,008
Maybe I'll make it a
little bit yellow.

180
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:44,044


181
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,079
The filtrate that just comes out
at this point, sometimes

182
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,026
it's called the glomerular
filtrate because it's been

183
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:52,016
filtered by the glomerulus, but
it's also been filtered by

184
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:55,005
those podocyte cells
on the inside of

185
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:56,047
the Bowman's capsule.

186
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:59,012
But now it's ready to go
to the proximal tubule.

187
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:03,008


188
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:06,052
Let me draw something
like this.

189
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:08,029
And obviously, this is not
exactly what it looks like,

190
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,058
but it gives you the sense.

191
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:17,047
This right here, this is
the proximal tubule.

192
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:20,055
And it sounds like a very fancy
word, but proximal just

193
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,059
means near and tubule, you can
imagine, is just a small tube.

194
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,074
So it's a small tube that's
near the beginning.

195
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,087
That's why it's called
a proximal tubule.

196
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:29,070
And it has two parts.

197
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,024
The whole thing is
often called a

198
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,087
proximal convoluted tubule.

199
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:35,087


200
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,038
That's because it's
all convoluted.

201
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:38,083
The way I've drawn
it is all curvy.

202
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,075
And I just drew it curvy
in two dimensions.

203
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:43,016
It's actually curvy in
three dimensions.

204
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,047
But the reality is there's a
curvy part and then there's a

205
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:48,022
straight part near the end
of the proximal tubule.

206
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,057
So we'll call this whole thing
the proximal tubule.

207
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,005
This is the convoluted part.

208
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,066
That's the straight
part, but we don't

209
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,034
have to get too picky.

210
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:59,003
But the whole point of this part
of the nephron-- and just

211
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:02,080
to remember where we are, we're
now at this point of the

212
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,088
nephron right there-- the
whole point is to start

213
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:09,070
reabsorbing some of the stuff
that is in the filtrate that

214
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,066
we don't want to lose.

215
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,087
We don't want to lose glucose.

216
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,089
That's hard-earned stuff
that we ate that

217
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,009
was good for energy.

218
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:18,078
We don't want to lose
necessarily as much sodium.

219
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,003
We've seen in multiple videos
that that's a useful ion to

220
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:24,048
have around.

221
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:26,049
We don't want to lose
amino acids.

222
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,049
Those are useful for building up
proteins and other things.

223
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,032
So these are things we don't
want to lose so we start

224
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,066
absorbing them back.

225
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,084
I'll do a whole video on exactly
how that happens, but

226
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,048
it's done actively.

227
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,057
Since we're using ATP, and just
as a bit of a summary,

228
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:43,089
you're using ATP to actually
pump out the sodium and then

229
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,065
that actually helps bring
in the other things.

230
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:48,015
That's just kind of a tidbit
on what's happening.

231
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:52,019
So we're reabsorbing, so just
imagine what's happening.

232
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,037
You have cells lining the
proximal tubule right now.

233
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:58,030
And actually, they have little
things that jut out.

234
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,078
I'll do a whole video on that
because it's actually

235
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,062
interesting.

236
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,090
So you have cells out here.

237
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,065
On the other side of the cells,
you have an arterial

238
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:08,011
system, or a capillary system,
I should say, actually.

239
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,008
So let's say you have a
capillary system here that is

240
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:16,058
very close to the cells lining
the proximal tubule, and so

241
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,013
this stuff actually gets
actively pumped, especially

242
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:23,000
the sodium, but all of it, using
energy, gets pumped back

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,088
into the blood selectively,
and maybe a

244
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:25,087
little bit of our water.

245
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:32,048
So we're pumping back some
sodium, some glucose, and

246
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,071
we'll start pumping a little
bit of the water back in

247
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,053
because we don't want to
lose all of that water.

248
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:38,062
If all of the water that was
originally in the filtrate we

249
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:41,055
were just leaving in our urine,
we'd be excreting

250
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:44,024
gallons and gallons of water
every day, which we do not

251
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:45,030
want to do.

252
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,050
So that's the whole point.

253
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,012
We're starting the absorption
process.

254
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,039
And then we'll enter the loop
of Henle, and actually, this

255
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,061
is, in my mind, the most

256
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:55,037
interesting part of the nephron.

257
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:59,092
So we're entering the loop of
Henle, and it dips down, and

258
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:03,067
then comes back up.

259
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,074
And so most of the length
of the nephron

260
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,089
is the loop of Henle.

261
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,091
And if I go back to this diagram
right here, if I'm

262
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,026
talking about the loop of Henle,
I'm talking about this

263
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,044
whole thing right there.

264
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:17,045
And you can see something
interesting here.

265
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:21,004
It crosses the border between
the cortex, this light brown

266
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:24,082
part, and the renal medulla,
this kind of reddish or orange

267
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,016
part right there, and it does
that for a very good reason.

268
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm going to draw it here.

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,071
So let's say this is the
dividing line right here.

270
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:35,046
This right here was
the cortex.

271
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:39,054
This right here is
the medulla.

272
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,005
So the whole point-- well,
there's two points

273
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,059
of the loop of Henle.

274
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:48,057


275
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:57,083
One point is to make the renal
medulla salty, and it does

276
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,050
this by actively pumping
out salts.

277
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,009
So it actively pumps out salts,
and it does that in the

278
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,013
ascending part of the
loop of Henle.

279
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:12,038
So it actively pumps out salts:
sodium, potassium,

280
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,044
chloride, or chlorine,
I should say.

281
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,050
Chlorine ions.

282
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,099
It actively pumps out these
salts right here to make the

283
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:27,066
entire medulla salty, or if we
think about it in terms of

284
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:29,099
kind of osmosis, make
it hypertonic.

285
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,032
You have more solute out here
than you have in the filtrate

286
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:36,000
that's going through
the tubules.

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,024
And it uses ATP to do this.

288
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,090
All of this stuff requires ATP
to actively pump against a

289
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,057
concentration gradient.

290
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:46,011
So this is salty and it's
salty for a reason.

291
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:50,082
It's not just to take back these
salts from the filtrate,

292
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:53,023
although that's part of the
reason, but by making this

293
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,062
salty, the ascending part is
only permeable to these salts

294
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,026
and these ions.

295
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,083
It's not permeable to water.

296
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:06,011


297
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,004
The descending part of the
loop of Henle is only

298
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,029
permeable to water.

299
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,038


300
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,037
So what's going to happen?

301
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:17,042
If this is all salty because the
ascending part is actively

302
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:21,025
pumping out salt, what's going
to happen to water as it goes

303
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,011
down the descending loop?

304
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,087
Well, it's hypertonic
out here.

305
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:28,083
Water will naturally want to go
and kind of try to make the

306
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,053
concentrations balance out.

307
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,050
I've done a whole
video on that.

308
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,067
It doesn't happen by magic.

309
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:36,071
And so the water will-- because
this is hypertonic,

310
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:39,062
it's more salty, and this is
only permeable to water, the

311
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:42,092
water will leave the membrane on
the descending part of the

312
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:44,055
loop of Henle right now.

313
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:48,071
And this is a major part
of water reabsorption.

314
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:52,087
I've thought a lot about why
don't we use ATP somehow to

315
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,036
actively pump water?

316
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,085
And the answer there
is, there's no

317
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,064
easy way to do that.

318
00:14:56,064 --> 00:15:01,012
Biological systems are good at
using ATP to pump out ions,

319
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,036
but it can't actively
pump out water.

320
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,036
Water's kind of a hard thing
for proteins to operate on.

321
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:09,058
So the solution is to make it
salty out here by pumping out

322
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:12,053
ions and then water, if you
make this porous only to

323
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,075
water, water will naturally
flow out.

324
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:18,016
So this is a major mechanism of
gaining back a lot of the

325
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,082
water that gets filtered
out up here.

326
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:23,038
And the reason why this is so
long is to give time for this

327
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:27,055
water to secrete out, and that's
why it dips nice and

328
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:31,049
pretty far down into
this salty portion.

329
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,071
So then we'll leave the loop of
Henle and then we're almost

330
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,011
done with the nephron.

331
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:38,078
Then we're in another convoluted
tubule, and you

332
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,071
might even guess the name of
this convoluted tubule.

333
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:44,086
If this was the proximal one,
this is the distal one.

334
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:47,007
And actually, just to make my
drawing correct, it actually

335
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:51,055
passes very close to the
Bowman's capsule, so let me do

336
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,080
it in a different color.

337
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,023


338
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:01,091
The distal convoluted tubule
actually goes pretty close to

339
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:03,097
the Bowman's capsule.

340
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:06,000
And once again, I've made
it all convoluted in two

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,074
dimensions, but it's actually
convoluted in three.

342
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,084
And it's not that long, but I
just had to get over here and

343
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,083
I wanted to get over that
point right there.

344
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,083
It's called distal.

345
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,050
Distal is further away.

346
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,075
It's convoluted and
it's a tubule.

347
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:24,045
So this right here is the distal
convoluted tubule, and

348
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:27,069
here we have more reabsorption:
calcium, more

349
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,082
sodium reabsorption.

350
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:31,025
We're just reabsorbing more
things that we didn't want to

351
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,060
lose in the first place.

352
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,017
There's a lot of things we
could talk about what get

353
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,033
reabsorbed, but this is
just the overview.

354
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:39,087
And we're also reabsorbing a
little bit of more water.

355
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:41,041
But then at the end
right here, our

356
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,079
filtrate has been processed.

357
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,028
A lot of the water's
been taken out.

358
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:45,075
It's a lot more concentrated.

359
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:47,070
We've reabsorbed a
lot of the salts,

360
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,028
electrolytes that we want.

361
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:52,010
We've reabsorbed the glucose and
a lot of the amino acids.

362
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,076
Everything that we want,
we've taken back.

363
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:55,062
We've reabsorbed.

364
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:59,071
And so this is mainly waste
products and water that we

365
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:01,066
don't need anymore and then
this gets dumped into

366
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,091
collecting ducts.

367
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,014


368
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,023
And you can kind of view this
as the trash chute of the

369
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:12,038
kidney, where multiple
nephrons are going

370
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:13,074
to dump into this.

371
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,096
So that might be the distal
tubule of another nephron

372
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:22,000
right here and this is a
collecting duct, which is just

373
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,056
a tube that's collecting
all the

374
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:27,003
byproducts of the nephrons.

375
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,061
And the interesting thing is
that the collecting duct

376
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,003
further goes into the
medulla again.

377
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:34,021
It goes into the medulla again
to the salty part again.

378
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:36,008
So if we're talking about the
collecting duct, maybe the

379
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:40,040
collecting ducts come back
into the medulla, collecting

380
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,006
all of the filtrate from
the different nephrons.

381
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:46,085
And because it goes back through
that super salty spot

382
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:50,024
in the medulla, we actually
have [a] hormone called

383
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:54,053
anti-diuretic hormone that
can dictate how porous this

384
00:17:54,053 --> 00:18:00,091
collecting tube is, and if it
makes it very porous, it

385
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:04,043
allows more water to leave as we
go to the medulla, because

386
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:06,010
this is very salty,
so the water will

387
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,069
leave if this is porous.

388
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,074
And when we do that, what that
does is it makes the

389
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:13,009
filtrate-- and we can maybe
start calling it urine now--

390
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,017
even more concentrated so we
lose even less water, and it

391
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:19,049
keeps collecting, collecting,
collecting until we end up

392
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,065
here, and it leaves the kidney
and goes via our ureters to

393
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,002
the urinary bladder.

394
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:27,020
So hopefully, you found
that helpful.

395
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,065
I think the neatest thing here
is just how we actively

396
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:33,015
reabsorb the water and how we--
well, actually, in my

397
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:36,076
mind, that is the neatest part
in the loop of Henle.

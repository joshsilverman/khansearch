1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,025


2
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,087
Let's just talk about the
humoral response right now,

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,017
that deals with B lymphocytes.

4
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:15,033
So B lymphocytes or B cells--
let me do them in blue.

5
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,019
So let's say that that
is a B lymphocyte.

6
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,071
It's a subset of white blood
cells called lymphocytes.

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:25,035
It comes from the bone marrow
and that's where the-- well,

8
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:27,035
the B comes from bursa of
Fabricius, but we don't want

9
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,044
to go into detail there.

10
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,076
But they have all of these
proteins on their surface.

11
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:34,028
Actually, close to
10,000 of them.

12
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,089
I get very excited about
B cells and I'll tell

13
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:36,054
you why in a second.

14
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:39,039
It has all of these proteins
on them that look

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,075
something like this.

16
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,011
I'll just draw a
couple of them.

17
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:46,024


18
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:48,074
These are actually protein
complexes, you can

19
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:49,032
kind of view them.

20
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:52,038
They actually have four separate
proteins on them and

21
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:57,021
we can call these proteins
membrane bound antibodies.

22
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:10,098


23
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:13,045
And I'll talk a lot more
about antibodies.

24
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:14,092
You've probably heard
the word.

25
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:17,085
You have antibodies for such and
such flu, or such and such

26
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:20,079
virus, and we're going to talk
more about that in the future,

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,006
but antibodies are
just proteins.

28
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,032
They're often referred to
as immunoglobulins.

29
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:36,012


30
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,035
These are essentially
equivalent words.

31
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:44,000
Antibodies or immunoglobulins--
and they're

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,056
really just proteins.

33
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:50,064
Now, B cells have these on the
surface of their membranes.

34
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,029
These are membrane bound.

35
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,004
Usually when people talk about
antibodies, they're talking

36
00:01:54,004 --> 00:02:00,014
about free antibodies that are
going to just be floating

37
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:01,026
around like that.

38
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,040
And I'm going to go into
more detail on

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,076
how those are produced.

40
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:08,000
Now what's really, really,
really, really, really

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,097
interesting about these membrane
bound antibodies and

42
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:17,021
these B cells in particular is
that a B cell has one type of

43
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,024
membrane bound antibody
on it .

44
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:27,019


45
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:29,072
It's going to also have
antibodies, but those

46
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:32,015
antibodies are going
to be different.

47
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,091
So we'll focus on where
they're different.

48
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:37,036
Let me just draw them the same
color first and then we'll

49
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,080
focus on where they're
different.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,053


51
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,084
These are both B cells.

52
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:49,018
They both have these
antibodies on them.

53
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:54,012
The interesting thing is that
from one B cell to another B

54
00:02:54,012 --> 00:03:00,019
cell, they have a variable part
on this antibody that

55
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,078
could take on a bunch of
different forms. So this one

56
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:06,096
might look like that and that.

57
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:09,071
So these long-- I'll go into
more detail on that.

58
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:17,006


59
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,059
The fixed portion, you can
imagine is green for any kind

60
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:22,050
of antibody, and then there's
a variable portion.

61
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,071
So maybe this guy's variable
portion is--

62
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,090
I'll do it in pink.

63
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,052
And every one of the antibodies
bound to his

64
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:32,021
membrane are going to have that
same variable portion.

65
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,009
This different B cell
is going to have

66
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,031
different variable portions.

67
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:38,063
So I'll do that in a
different color.

68
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,027
Maybe I'll do it in magenta.

69
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:42,068
So his variable portions are
going to be different.

70
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:47,084


71
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:50,040
Now he has 10,000 of these on
a surface and every one of

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,016
these have the same variable
portions, but they're all

73
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:57,059
different from the variable
portions on this B cell.

74
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,011
There's actually 10 billion
different combinations of

75
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,036
variable portions.

76
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:14,058


77
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,077
So the first question-- and I
haven't even told you what the

78
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:19,063
variable portions are good for--
is, how do that many

79
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:21,014
different combinations arise?

80
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:23,099
Obviously these proteins-- or
maybe not so obviously-- all

81
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,042
these proteins that are part of
most cells are produced by

82
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,019
the genes of that cell.

83
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,019
So if I draw-- this
is the nucleus.

84
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,005
It's got DNA inside
the nucleus.

85
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,024
This guy has a nucleus.

86
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,036
It's got DNA inside
the nucleus.

87
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:41,041
If these guys are both B cells
and they're both coming from

88
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:46,000
the same germ line, they're
coming from the same, I guess,

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,018
ancestry of cells, shouldn't
they have the same DNA?

90
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:57,093


91
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:01,030
If they do have the same DNA,
why are the proteins that

92
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,052
they're constructing
different?

93
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,080
How do they change?

94
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,008
And this is why I find B cells--
and you'll see this is

95
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,072
also true of T cells-- to be
fascinating is, in their

96
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:17,093
development, in their
hematopoiesis-- that's just

97
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:20,061
the development of these
lymphocytes.

98
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:22,095
At one stage in their
development, there's just a

99
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:25,099
lot of shuffling of the portion
of their DNA that

100
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:30,019
codes for here, for these
parts of the protein.

101
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,099
There's just a lot of shuffling
that occurs.

102
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,007
Most of when we talk about
DNA, we really want to

103
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,050
preserve the information, not
have a lot of shuffling.

104
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,011
But when these lymphocytes,
when these B cells are

105
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:46,026
maturing, at one stage of their
maturation or their

106
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:50,012
development, there's intentional
reshuffling of the

107
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,049
DNA that codes for this
part and this part.

108
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:56,016
And that's what leads to all
of the diversity in the

109
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,098
variable portions on these
membrane bound

110
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,076
immunoglobulins.

111
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:02,062
And we're about to find out why
there's that diversity.

112
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:07,088
So there's tons of stuff that
can infect your body.

113
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:12,022
Viruses are are mutating and
evolving and so are bacteria.

114
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:14,049
You don't know what's going
to enter your body.

115
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:18,048
So what the immune system has
done through B cells-- and

116
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:22,019
we'll also see it through T
cells-- it says, hey, let me

117
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,093
just make a bunch of
combinations of these things

118
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,047
that can essentially bind
to whatever I get to.

119
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:33,000
So let's say that there's
just some new virus

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,089
that shows up, right?

121
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:40,018
The world has never seen this
virus before this B cell,

122
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:42,093
it'll bump into this virus and
this virus won't attach.

123
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:44,075
Another B cell will bump
into this virus

124
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:45,074
and it won't attach.

125
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:49,037
And maybe several thousands of
B cells will bump into this

126
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:52,062
virus and it won't attach, but
since I have so many B cells

127
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,062
having so many different
combinations of these variable

128
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:59,056
portions on these receptors,
eventually one of these B

129
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,064
cells is going to bond.

130
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:01,089
Maybe it's this one.

131
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:06,012


132
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:09,062
He's going to bond to part of
the surface of this virus.

133
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,043
It could also be to part of a
surface of a new bacteria, or

134
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:16,062
part of a surface for some
foreign protein.

135
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:21,007
And part of the surface that it
binds on the bacteria-- so

136
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,005
maybe it binds on that part of
the bacteria-- this is called

137
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:25,030
an epitope.

138
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,035


139
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:33,019
So once this guy binds to some
foreign pathogen-- and

140
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,073
remember, the other B cells
won't-- only the particular

141
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,079
one that had the particular
combination, one of

142
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,075
the 10 to the 10th.

143
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:41,000
And actually, there aren't 10
to the 10th combinations.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,031
During their development,
they weed out all of the

145
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:48,075
combinations that would bind to
things that are essentially

146
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:52,006
you, that there shouldn't be
an immune response to.

147
00:07:52,006 --> 00:08:00,035
So we could say self-responding
combinations

148
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:02,055
weeded out.

149
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,094
So there actually aren't 10
to the 10th, 10 billion

150
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,068
combinations of these--
something smaller than that.

151
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,093
You have to take out all the
combinations that would have

152
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:12,076
bound to your own cells, but
there's still a super huge

153
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,000
number of combinations that are
very likely to bond, at

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,045
least to some part of some
pathogen of some

155
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:19,019
virus or some bacteria.

156
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,068
And as soon as one of these B
cells binds, it says, hey

157
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,064
guys, I'm the lucky guy who
happens to fit exactly this

158
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:28,011
brand new pathogen.

159
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:36,090
He becomes activated after
binding to the new pathogen.

160
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,062
And I'm going to go into more
detail in the future.

161
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:43,087
In order to really become
activated, you normally need

162
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:46,021
help from helper T cells,
but I don't want to

163
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,061
confuse you in the video.

164
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:50,054
So in this case, I'm going to
assume that activation can

165
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:54,069
only occur-- or that it just
needs to respond, it just

166
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,008
needs to essentially
be triggered by

167
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:59,020
binding with the pathogen.

168
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,066
In most cases, you
actually need the

169
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,078
helper T cells as well.

170
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,041
And we'll discuss why
that's important.

171
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,027
It's kind of a fail
safe mechanism

172
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:07,009
for your immune system.

173
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:11,083
But once this guy gets
activated, he's going to start

174
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,005
cloning himself.

175
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:17,050
He's going to say, look, I'm
the guy that can match this

176
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,038
virus here-- and so he's going
to start cloning himself.

177
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:24,080
He's going to start dividing
and repeating himself.

178
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,000
So there's just going to be
multiple versions of this guy.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:41,063


180
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:45,024
So they all start to replicate
and they also differentiate--

181
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:48,011
differentiate means they start
taking particular roles.

182
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,035
So there's two forms
of differentiation.

183
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:54,010
So many, many, many hundreds
or thousands of these are

184
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,026
going to be produced.

185
00:09:55,026 --> 00:10:01,021
And then some are going to
become memory cells, which are

186
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:05,085
essentially just B cells that
stick around a long time with

187
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:09,065
the perfect receptor on them,
with the perfect variable

188
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:11,050
portion of their receptor
on them.

189
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:21,080


190
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,044
So some will be memory cells
and they're going to be in

191
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:25,013
higher quantities than
they were originally.

192
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:28,076
So if if this guy invades our
bodies 10 years in the future,

193
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:31,012
they're going to have more of
these guys around that are

194
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:34,053
more likely to bump into them
and start and get activated

195
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,071
and then some of them
are going to turn

196
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,075
into effector cells.

197
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,063
And effector cells are generally
cells that actually

198
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,088
do something.

199
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:44,089


200
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,058
What the effector cells do is,
they turn into antibody-- they

201
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:53,004
turn into these effector B
cells-- or sometimes they're

202
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,002
called plasma cells.

203
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:59,017
They're going to turn into
antibody factories.

204
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:03,062


205
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,069
And the antibodies they're going
to produce are exactly

206
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:10,079
this combination, the date that
they originally had being

207
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,004
membrane bound.

208
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,023
So they're just going to start
producing these antibodies

209
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:19,064
that we talk about with the
exact-- they're going to start

210
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:22,025
spitting out these antibodies.

211
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:24,066
They're going to start spitting
out tons and tons of

212
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:28,065
these proteins that are uniquely
able to bind to the

213
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:32,034
new pathogen, this new
thing in question.

214
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:35,024


215
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:40,042
So an activated effector cell
will actually produce 2,000

216
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,059
antibodies a second.

217
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,026
So you can imagine, if you have
a lot of these, you're

218
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:46,028
going to have all of a sudden
a lot of antibodies floating

219
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:49,050
around in your body and going
into the body tissues.

220
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,060
And the value of that and why
this is the humoral system is,

221
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,055
all of a sudden, you have all
of these viruses that are

222
00:11:54,055 --> 00:12:01,001
infecting your system, but now
you're producing all of these

223
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,082
antibodies.

224
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:05,067
The effector cells are these
factories and so these

225
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,096
specific antibodies will
start bonding.

226
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,050
So let me draw it like this.

227
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:16,013


228
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:22,037
The specific antibodies will
start bonding to these viruses

229
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:28,036
and that has a couple
of values to it.

230
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,017
One is, it essentially tags
them for pick up.

231
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,070
Now phagocytosis-- this is
called opsonization.

232
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:40,037


233
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:42,073
When you tag molecules for
pickup and you make them

234
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:51,025
easier for phagocytes to eat
them up, this is what--

235
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,060
antibodies are attaching and
say, hey phagocytes, this is

236
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,028
going to make it easier.

237
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:56,075
You should pick up these
guys in particular.

238
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,017
It also might make these viruses
hard to function.

239
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,024
I have this big thing hanging
off the side of it.

240
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:04,011
It might be harder for them to
infiltrate cells and the other

241
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:09,011
thing is, on each of these
antibodies you have two

242
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:13,046
identical heavy chains
and then two

243
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,071
identical light chains.

244
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:17,012


245
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,025
And then they have a very
specific variable portion on

246
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:25,045
each one and each of these
branches can bond to the

247
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:29,075
epitope on a virus.

248
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,097
So you can imagine, what happens
if this guy bonds to

249
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:34,075
one epitope and this guy
bonds to another virus?

250
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:37,011
Then all of a sudden, these
viruses are kind of glued

251
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:38,095
together and that's even
more efficient.

252
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,067
They're not going to be able to
do what they normally do.

253
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:43,090
They're not going to be able
to enter cell membranes and

254
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,034
they're perfectly tagged.

255
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:48,064
They've been opsonized so
that phagocytes can come

256
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:49,051
and eat them up.

257
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:51,076
So we'll talk more about B cells
in the future, but I

258
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:53,048
just find it fascinating that
there are that many

259
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,010
combinations and they have
enough combinations to really

260
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,021
recognize almost anything that
can exist in the fluids of our

261
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,075
body, but we haven't solved
all of the problems yet.

262
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,095
We haven't solved the problem
of what happens when things

263
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:08,005
actually infiltrate cells
or we have cancer cells?

264
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:11,026
How do we kill cells that have
clearly gone astray?

265
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:12,085

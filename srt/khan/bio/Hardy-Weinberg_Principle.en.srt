1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,051


2
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,022
I've already started with the
eye color example so I figured

3
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,015
no harm in continuing it.

4
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:09,016
Let's say we live on a planet
or we're a species where

5
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:18,008
there's only two possible eye
colors: either blue-- and the

6
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,026
genotype or the allele for blue
I'll abbreviate with a

7
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:26,058
lowercase b --or you could
have brown eyes.

8
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:28,096
I'm doing it in this salmon
color just because I got tired

9
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:29,089
of the brown.

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,004
We'll do an uppercase B.

11
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,061
And I'll make a few other
simplifying assumptions.

12
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:39,078
First of all, let's assume that
the expression of this

13
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:44,089
gene is very simple, that brown
is dominant to blue.

14
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:46,040
So if you have one of
each, you're going

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,042
to see brown eyes.

16
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:50,017
The only way you're going to see
blue eyes is if you have a

17
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:53,038
blue allele from each
of your parents.

18
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:56,021
And the other assumptions I'm
going to make is that this

19
00:00:56,021 --> 00:01:01,067
population essentially has a
stable gene pool with respect

20
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,029
to the eye color gene.

21
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,056
What do I mean by that?

22
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:11,040
No selection is taking place, no
natural selection based on

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,009
this trait.

24
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,003
So, for example, you're not more
or less likely to be able

25
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,084
to reproduce, or the number of
children you have is not going

26
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:23,029
to be larger or greater
dependent on what your eye

27
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,012
color is in this population.

28
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm also going to assume that
there's no mutations.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,012


30
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:33,045
So for whatever reason, a
chromosome that has a blue

31
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:36,012
allele can't randomly turn into
a brown or vice versa or

32
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,065
turn into a third color.

33
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:39,018
I'm also going to assume that
I'm going to have a large

34
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,043
population.

35
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:43,054


36
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:45,095
The reason why I'm making all
of these assumptions is

37
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:49,040
because I essentially want to
have a stable gene pool, at

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,042
least relative to this gene.

39
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:56,045
Relative to the eye color gene,
I want to be stable.

40
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:59,053
I want to have a stable
allele frequency.

41
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,054
What do I mean by allele
frequency?

42
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:08,011


43
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:10,040
I said a large population, but
let's take a very small

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,096
population.

45
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:16,088
Let's say that there's two
people in the population, and

46
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:27,046
one guy right here, his
genotype is big B and

47
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:31,005
lowercase B, and let's say that
the other guy has blue

48
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,028
eyes, so he has to be homozygous
recessive.

49
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,022
Let's say this is the
entire population.

50
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,084
Of course, a population of two
can't apply to what I'm about

51
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:41,000
to do, but I just want explain
allele frequency.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,096
The allele frequency here of the
blue eyes, the blue-eyed

53
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:49,013
allele frequency
here, is what?

54
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:52,030
Well, in this population, I
have exactly four alleles.

55
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,015
I only have two individuals,
but they

56
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,069
each have two alleles.

57
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,081
So it's going to be 75%.

58
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:03,080
75% of the alleles in this
population are blue, right?

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,000
There's one, two, three,
four alleles, and

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,065
three of them are blue.

61
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:13,063
The frequency of the brown
allele is 25%.

62
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:16,006
And this is different than
the actual expression.

63
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:19,038
If I asked you the frequency
of brown eyes versus blue

64
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:22,078
eyes-- So this is allele
frequency.

65
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,087
Let me write that down.

66
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:27,005
That's allele frequency
right there.

67
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:37,058
If I were ask you phenotype
frequency, if I said how

68
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:42,041
frequent are blue eyes seen
in my population?

69
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,096
Well, it's only one out of the
two people in my population,

70
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:48,002
so you'd say it's 50%, and then
for brown eyes, you would

71
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:52,078
say it's 50%.

72
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,049
So I want to make this
distinction very clear because

73
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,093
it can be very confusing
when people talk

74
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,031
about allele frequency.

75
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:59,078
Allele frequency is literally
if you were able to go and

76
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:02,094
look at the actual genotype,
the actual chromosomes of

77
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:05,022
every person in the population,
and count how many

78
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:07,094
of them had the blue allele
versus the brown allele, you

79
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,040
would come up with
this number.

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,068
This is different than the
actual phenotype frequency.

81
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:17,093
Now, all of that is just as a
background, because if these

82
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:23,016
set of assumptions are true and
my population isn't in any

83
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:26,036
way evolving, then my allele
frequency is going to be

84
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,086
roughly constant.

85
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:29,080
I have to assume a large
population, because a small

86
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,025
population, just from random
chance, my allele frequency

87
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,070
could start to change.

88
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,020
But let's say my allele
frequency is constant, then

89
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,017
I'm in a Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.

90
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:48,008


91
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:50,006
All this is a situation
where the allele

92
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,031
frequency isn't changing.

93
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:54,050


94
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,038
The reason why we're making all
of those assumptions is

95
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:00,044
because, if we can assume this,
we can start to deduce

96
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:04,023
some things about what we
observe, what must be the

97
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:06,081
genotypes in the population or
the frequencies of different

98
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,087
phenotypes and whatever else.

99
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:15,036
So, for example, if p is the
frequency of blue eyes, so let

100
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:20,093
me say p is equal to the
frequency of blue eyes, and q

101
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:26,030
is equal to the frequency of
brown eyes, what's p plus q

102
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,093
going to be?

103
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,089
What's p plus q?

104
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,080
Well, everything is either going
to have blue eyes or

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,042
brown eyes.

106
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:37,030
If this is 20%-- And anyway,
this is the allele.

107
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,049
Let me make that b allele.

108
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,072
Let me make that very clear.

109
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,050
This isn't necessarily
what you observe.

110
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,064
This is the allele itself.

111
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,030
This is the allele frequency, if
you were actually to count

112
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,092
the chromosomes and see what
percentage have the blue

113
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,032
allele and what percentage
have the

114
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,017
uppercase brown allele.

115
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:58,051
Well, every chromosome has to
have either of those, so these

116
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:03,013
are going to add up to
100%, or equal to 1.

117
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:08,020
For example, if 30% of the
alleles are blue, then 70% are

118
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,008
going to have to be brown
because, I already told you at

119
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,058
the beginning of this video,
that we're in a world where

120
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:15,064
you either have a blue allele
or a brown allele.

121
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:17,044
Now, what if we don't care about
alleles, we actually

122
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:22,070
care about the frequency
of the genotypes?

123
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,000
So there's a couple of
things we could do.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,086
We could literally just square
both sides of this and then

125
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,006
think about what
that gives us.

126
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:31,035
If we square both sides as this
equation, you get what? p

127
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:36,056
plus q squared is p squared plus
2pq plus q squared, and

128
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:40,037
you square the other side and
it's equal to 1 as well.

129
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,018
What does this tell us?

130
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,094
What is p squared?

131
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:48,008
Well, it's the probability
that I get two of the

132
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,095
lowercase blue alleles, right?

133
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:54,026
What's the probability that I
get two, that I end up with

134
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:57,043
lowercase b, lowercase
b as my genotype?

135
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:00,031
Well, I have to get a lowercase
b from my first

136
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:03,064
parent, and that's with a
probability of p, and then a

137
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:05,037
lowercase b from my second
parent with a

138
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,030
probability of p.

139
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,061
So it's p times p, so
that's p squared.

140
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:12,080
What's q squared?

141
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Well, that's the probability
that I get a big B, a

142
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,018
brown-eyed allele from each
parent, because the

143
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:21,097
probability from parent 1 is q
and then the probability from

144
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:24,039
parent 2 is also q.

145
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,031
So that's q squared
right there.

146
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,056
Now, what's 2pq?

147
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:31,013


148
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,099
Well, essentially, this
entire term is the

149
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,087
frequency that I'm a hybrid.

150
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:40,000
I have a heterozygous
genotype.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,025
And why is that?

152
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,083
Because there's two ways that
I can be a heterozygote.

153
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,057


154
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:49,058
I could be like this.

155
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:52,000
I want to do that other blue.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,019
I could get blue eyes from one
parent and brown eyes from the

157
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:58,089
other or I could get brown eyes
from the first parent and

158
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,019
blue eyes from the second.

159
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,038
I don't know anything about
these parents, so if I'm

160
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,020
making no assumptions, then I
just have to assume that the

161
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,075
probability that I get an allele
from either one of them

162
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:14,064
is equal to the frequency
in the population.

163
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,054
So there's two ways
of getting these.

164
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:18,077
The probability of each of these
ways, the probability of

165
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:21,044
this combination,
is p times q.

166
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,062
The probability of this is q
times p, which is the same

167
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:26,095
thing, and you add them together
and you get 2pq.

168
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:30,000
So this is essentially the
frequency of the hybrids in

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,013
the population.

170
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,092
I've been kind of
abstract so far.

171
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:37,050
Let's see if we can apply this
to a real world problem, and

172
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,032
obviously, I'm making some
simplifying assumptions.

173
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:42,030
Let's say that we go
into a population.

174
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,026
Let's say it's a population of
a million people, reasonably

175
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:53,072
large, and we observe that
9% have blue eyes.

176
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:55,094
This is their phenotype.

177
00:08:55,094 --> 00:09:02,029
This is the frequency of the
genotype lowercase b,

178
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,084
lowercase b, right?

179
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:07,092
I started with this phenotype
blue eyes, but I know, since

180
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:13,044
blue is a recessive trait, that
they must have two copies

181
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,008
of the recessive allele.

182
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:18,027
So this is the frequency.

183
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:22,077
The frequency of having two
lowercase b's is 9%.

184
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,091
Well, if you just look here, I
just showed you that that's

185
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,086
also equal to p squared.

186
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:30,000
p squared is equal to 9%.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,021
And how do you think
about that?

188
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,003
Well, p is the probability
of getting a blue allele.

189
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:35,085
It's the frequency of the blue
allele in the population.

190
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:38,042
In order to get two of them,
you have to multiply p by

191
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,090
itself twice.

192
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,022
So what's the frequency of the
blue allele in the population?

193
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:48,067
p is equal to the square root
of 0.09, which is 0.3.

194
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,095
So if you went and actually
counted all of the alleles in

195
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:56,092
the population, you would
actually find that 30% of them

196
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:59,040
are the lowercase blue.

197
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,074
Now, a much smaller percentage
of people, only 9%, showed the

198
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:04,034
blue eyes because you
need two of them.

199
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:07,000
You have a 30% chance of getting
it from your mom and a

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,054
30% chance of getting
it from your dad.

201
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:16,011
So what's the frequency of
a brown-eyed allele?

202
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:19,012


203
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,088
Well, we know that the frequency
of the blue eyes

204
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:25,076
plus the brown eyes is 100%,
so that's going to be 70%.

205
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:31,010
If 30% of all of the chromosomes
or of all of the

206
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,017
alleles in the population are
blue, the other 70% are going

207
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,001
to have to be brown.

208
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,009
So what percentage of my
population are going to be--

209
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,075
Well, there's a couple
of things we can do.

210
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:43,072
What percentage of my population
are going to have--

211
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,048
Well, I'll do an easy one.

212
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:46,021
What percentage of my population
are going to have

213
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:50,004
brown eyes, so if I just look
at the phenotype brown eyes?

214
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:51,016
I don't even have to
use any of these

215
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,052
formulas for this one.

216
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,063
I already told you 9% have blue
eyes, so the rest must

217
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:58,027
have brown eyes.

218
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,087
So 91% percent have
brown eyes.

219
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:05,070


220
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,007
Now, we just said we have 9% who
have blue eyes, 91% have

221
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:11,094
brown eyes.

222
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:14,037
What percentage of the
population are going to be

223
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:17,063
homozygous for brown eyes?

224
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:21,075
So they need to have the capital
B from both parents.

225
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:24,032
Well, we know that the frequency
of the capital B

226
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:28,037
allele is 70%, so what
percent are going to

227
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,083
be homozygous dominant?

228
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,033
Let me draw that.

229
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,090
Homozygous dominant.

230
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,040
Well, the frequency is going
to be q squared.

231
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,007
They're going to have
to get a q.

232
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,003
They're going to have to get
an uppercase B from each

233
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,032
parent, so that's going to be
0.7 squared, which is equal to

234
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:52,021
0.49, or 49%.

235
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:56,012
So just starting already from
that one idea, from that one

236
00:11:56,012 --> 00:12:02,094
idea that 9% have blue eyes,
we've already been able deduce

237
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:08,046
that 91% must have brown eyes.

238
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:12,000
And of the 91% of the brown eyes
of the whole population,

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,023
49%-- this isn't
49% of the 91%.

240
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:17,077
This is 49% of the population.

241
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:21,005
49% percent are homozygous
dominant.

242
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:25,073


243
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:28,075
And then what percentage
of the population

244
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,035
are going to be hybrids?

245
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:32,075
Well, hybrids also have brown
eyes, but they're not

246
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:35,034
homozygous dominant, so
the remainder here.

247
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,069
So what is that?

248
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:42,001
That's 42%.

249
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:49,001
42% are going to be hybrids.

250
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,053
And if we go back to
the Hardy-Weinberg

251
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:53,076
equation, we see that.

252
00:12:53,076 --> 00:13:01,011
So we get p plus q has to be
equal to 100%, or I could just

253
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:02,060
write equal to 1.

254
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,039
And we figured out
that p was 30%.

255
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,045
That's the frequency of the
blue-eyed allele, the actual

256
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:12,098
trait, not the observation
of it or the genotype.

257
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:16,005
And the frequency of the
brown eyes was 70%.

258
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,008
And then this is actually a
breakdown when you square

259
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:23,082
that, so we also know that
p squared plus 2pq plus q

260
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:26,009
squared is equal to 1.

261
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,061
This is the percentage of the
population that has blue eyes.

262
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:33,080
They have two blue alleles,
so that's 9%.

263
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,087
This is the percentage of the
population that has two brown

264
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:42,045
alleles, homozygous dominant,
so that is 49%.

265
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:46,012
And then the remainder, this
2pq, this whole term right

266
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:47,034
here is what's left over.

267
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:52,095
So 9 plus this 58, this
is going to be 42%.

268
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:55,075
42% are hybrids.

269
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:59,062
And if I just talked about
phenotypes, I'd say 9% have

270
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:02,095
blue eyes and then
the remainder,

271
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:06,004
91%, have brown eyes.

272
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:08,000
Hopefully, you found that
reasonably useful.

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,041
Just from very simple
deductions, it's almost kind

274
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,012
of silly that this is almost a
separate principle, because

275
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:20,025
you can kind of deduce this from
very basic ideas, and you

276
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,077
can square both sides of that.

277
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,073
But you can come up with some
fairly fascinating results

278
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,039
about what's going on in a
population because we can

279
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,018
observe maybe the frequency of,
let's say, some disease

280
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:35,025
that only happens when someone
is homozygous recessive.

281
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:37,040
So you can go and see, OK,
what percentage of the

282
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,025
population has that disease, but
then doing the math that

283
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,060
we just did in this video, you
can figure out what percentage

284
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,052
of the population have the
allele for the disease.

285
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,011
They're carriers for the
disease, but they don't

286
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,075
actually show it, and
that would be the

287
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,067
hybrids right there.

288
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,029
So this is actually
a pretty powerful

289
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,038
tool you've just learned.

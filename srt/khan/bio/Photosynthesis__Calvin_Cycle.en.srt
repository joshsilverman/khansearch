1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,037


2
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:03,012
I think we're now ready to learn
a little bit about the

3
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:04,057
dark reactions.

4
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:07,029
But just to remember where we
are in this whole scheme of

5
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:12,075
photosynthesis, photons came
in and excited electrons in

6
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,051
chlorophyll in the
light reactions.

7
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:17,050
and as those photons went to
lower and lower energy

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,025
states-- we saw it over here
in the last video-- as they

9
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:22,085
went to lower and lower energy
states, and all of this was

10
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:26,012
going on in the thylacoid
membrane right over here.

11
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,092
You can imagine-- Let me do
it in a different color.

12
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:29,098
You can imagine it occurring
right here.

13
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:32,061
As they went into lower and
lower energy states, two

14
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,035
things happened.

15
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,046
One, the release of energy was
able to pump the hydrogens

16
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:38,064
across this membrane.

17
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,079
And then when you had a high
concentration of hydrogens

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,038
here, those went back through
the ATP synthase and drove

19
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:47,035
that motor to produce ATP.

20
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:50,043
And then the final electron
acceptor, or hydrogen

21
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:51,084
acceptor, depending on how
you want to view it.

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:55,053
The whole hydrogen atom
was NAD plus.

23
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:59,057
So the two byproducts, or the
two byproducts that we're

24
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:03,054
going to continue using in
photosynthesis from our light

25
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:06,054
cycle, from our light
reactions I guess.

26
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:09,078
I shouldn't call it the light
cycle-- were-- I wrote it up

27
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:13,029
here-- ATP and NADPH.

28
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:16,004
And then the byproduct was that
we needed the electron to

29
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,095
replace that first
excited electron.

30
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:19,073
So we take it away from water.

31
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:22,073
And so we also produce oxygen,
which is a very valuable

32
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:24,042
byproduct of this reaction.

33
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:28,095
But now that we have this ATP
and this NADPH, we're ready to

34
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:31,068
proceed into the
dark reactions.

35
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:34,018
And I want to highlight again,
even though it's called the

36
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:37,028
dark reactions it doesn't mean
that it happens at night.

37
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:40,051
It actually happens at the same
time as light reactions.

38
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,096
It occurs while the
sun is out.

39
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:45,046
The reason why they call it
the dark reactions is that

40
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:46,085
they're light independent.

41
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,064
They don't require photons.

42
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:53,092
They only require ATP, NADPH,
and carbon dioxide.

43
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:55,065
So let's understand what's
going on here

44
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,034
a little bit better.

45
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,090
So let me go down to
where I have some

46
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,029
clean space down here.

47
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:03,073
So we had our light reactions.

48
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:08,063


49
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:13,018
And they produced-- I just
reviewed this-- produced some

50
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:19,087
ATP and produced
some and NADPH.

51
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:22,087
And now we're going to take some
carbon dioxide from the

52
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,012
atmosphere.

53
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:27,015


54
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:30,008
And all of this will go into
the-- I'll call it the light

55
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:31,016
independent reactions.

56
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,071
Because dark reactions
is misleading.

57
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:45,000
So the light independent
reactions, the actual

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,027
mechanism is called
the Calvin Cycle.

59
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:50,011
And that's what this video
is really about.

60
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:57,037
It goes into the Calvin Cycle
and out pops-- whether you

61
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:00,018
want to call it PGAL-- we talked
about it in the first

62
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:03,043
video-- or G3P.

63
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:06,034
This is glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

64
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:09,088
This is phosphoglyceraldehyde
They are the exact same

65
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,041
molecule, just different
names.

66
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,096
And you can imagine it as
a 3-carbon chain with a

67
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:19,025
phosphate group.

68
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:23,015
And then this can then be used
to build other carbohydrates.

69
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:25,063
You put two of these together
you can get a glucose.

70
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:28,094
You might remember in the first
stage of glycolysis, or

71
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:31,072
the first time we cut a glucose
molecule we ended up

72
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:34,049
with two phosphoglyceraldehyde
molecules.

73
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,096
Glucose has six carbons.

74
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,099
This has three.

75
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,034
Let's study the Calvin
Cycle in just a

76
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,012
little bit more detail.

77
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:51,041
So let's say exiting the light
reactions, let's say we have--

78
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,000
well let's start off with
six carbon dioxides.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,078
So this is independent of
the light reactions.

80
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,056
And I'll show you why I'm
using these numbers.

81
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:00,056
I don't have to use these
exact numbers.

82
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:03,044
So let's say I start
off with six CO2s.

83
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,075
And I could write a CO2 because
we really care about

84
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,075
what's happening
to the carbon.

85
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:09,031
We can just write it as a single
carbon that has two

86
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,000
oxygens on it, which
I could draw.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,015
But I'm not going to draw
them right now.

88
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:13,059
Because I want to really
show you what

89
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:15,009
happens to the carbons.

90
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,049
Maybe I should draw this
in this yellow.

91
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,092
Just to show you only
the carbons.

92
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,037
I'm not showing you the
oxygens on here.

93
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:30,017
And what happens is the CO2,
the six CO2s, essentially

94
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:33,024
react with-- and I'll talk a
little bit about this reaction

95
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:39,085
in a second-- they react with
six molecules-- and this is

96
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:41,063
going to look a little bit
strange to you-- of this

97
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:45,010
molecule, you could
call it RuBP.

98
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,062
That's short for ribulose
biphosphate.

99
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:52,000
Sometimes called ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,043
And the reason why it's called
that is because it's a

101
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,062
5-carbon molecule.

102
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,070
So, three, four five.

103
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,083
And it has a phosphate on
the 1 and 5 carbon.

104
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,082
So it's ribulose bisphosphate.

105
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:12,039
Or sometimes, ribulosee-1-- let
me write this-- that's the

106
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,090
first carbon.

107
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,045
5-bisphosphate.

108
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:17,085
We have two phosphates.

109
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,070
So that's ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

110
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,075
Fancy name, but it's just
a 5-carbon chain with 2

111
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,094
phosphates on it.

112
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:27,056
These two react together.

113
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:31,050
And this is a simplification.

114
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,080
These two react together.

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,077
There's a lot more going on
here, but I want you to get

116
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:35,095
the big picture.

117
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:45,043
to form, 12 molecules of PGAL,
of phosphoglyceraldehyde or

118
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:53,033
glyceraldihyde 3-phosphate of
PGAL, which you can view as

119
00:05:53,033 --> 00:06:01,000
a-- it has three carbons and
then it has a phosphate group.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,030
And just to make sure we're
accounting for our carbons

121
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,056
properly, let's think
about what happens.

122
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:08,077
We have 12 of these guys.

123
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,051
You can think of it that
we have-- 12 times

124
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,050
3-- we have 36 carbons.

125
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,050
Now did we start with
36 carbons?

126
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,043
Well we have 6 times 5 carbons.

127
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,025
That's 30.

128
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,063
Plus another 6 here.

129
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:19,006
So, yes.

130
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,057
We have 36 carbons.

131
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:25,025
They react with each other
to form this PGAL.

132
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:28,068
The bonds or the electrons in
this molecule are in a higher

133
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:32,001
energy state than the electrons
in this molecule.

134
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,089
So we have to add energy
in order for

135
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,042
this reaction to happen.

136
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,048
This won't happen
spontaneously.

137
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:40,062
And the energy for this
reaction, if we use the

138
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:44,016
numbers 6 and 6 here, the energy
from this reaction is

139
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:51,088
going to come from 12 ATPs-- you
could imagine 2 ATPs for

140
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:54,004
every carbon and every ribulose

141
00:06:54,004 --> 00:07:02,099
bisphosphate; and 12 NADPHs.

142
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,089
I don't want to get you confused
with-- it's very

143
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:07,022
similar to NADH, but I don't
want to get you confused with

144
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,056
what goes on in respiration.

145
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:17,010
And then these leave as 12 ADPs
plus 12 phosphate groups.

146
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:25,045
And then you're going to have
plus 12 NADP pluses.

147
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,097
And the reason why this is a
source of energy is because

148
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:30,042
the electrons in NADPH, or you
could say the hydrogen with

149
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:33,031
the electron in NADPH, is at
a higher energy state.

150
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,029
So as it goes to lower
energy state, it

151
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,068
helps drive a reaction.

152
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:40,036
And of course ATPs, when they
lose their phosphate groups,

153
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:42,037
those electrons are in a very
high energy state, they enter

154
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:45,055
a lower energy state, help drive
a reaction, help put

155
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,000
energy into a reaction.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,062
So then we have these
12 PGALs.

157
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:54,014
Now the reason why it's called
a Calvin Cycle-- as you can

158
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,068
imagine-- we studied
the Kreb Cycle.

159
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,013
Cycles start reusing things.

160
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,095
The reason why it's called the
Calvin Cycle is because we do

161
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:04,056
reuse, actually, most
of these PGALs.

162
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:12,066
So of the 12 PGALs, we're going
to use 10 of them to--

163
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:15,039
let me actually do
it this way.

164
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,077
So we're going to
have 10 PGALs.

165
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:23,031
10 phosphoglyceraldehydes 10
PGALs we're going to use to

166
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:26,014
recreate the ribulose
bisphosphate.

167
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:27,043
And the counting works.

168
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:29,052
Because we have ten 3-carbon
molecules.

169
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,091
That's 30 carbons.

170
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:33,020
Then we have six 5-carbon
molecules.

171
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,030
30 carbons.

172
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,058
But this, once again, is
going to take energy.

173
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:41,051
This is going to take the
energy from six ATPs.

174
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:45,059
So you're going to have six ATPs
essentially losing their

175
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,025
phosphate group.

176
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,074
The electrons enter
lower energy

177
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,048
states, drive reactions.

178
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:54,065
And you're going to have six
ADPs plus six phosphate groups

179
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,000
that get released.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,059
And so you see it as a cycle.

181
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,004
But the question is, well
gee I used all of these.

182
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,025
What do I get out of it?

183
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,040
Well I only used 10
out of the 12.

184
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,089
So I have 2 PGALs left.

185
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,027


186
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,070
And these can then be used--
and the reason why I used 6

187
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,091
and 6 is so that
I get 12 here.

188
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:16,014
And I get 2 here.

189
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,078
And the reason why I have 2 here
is because 2 PGALs can be

190
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:22,089
used to make at glucose.

191
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,086
Which is a 6-carbon molecule.

192
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:31,000
It's formula, we've seen
it before, is C6H12O6.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,013
But it's important to remember
that it doesn't have to just

194
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:34,065
be glucose.

195
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:36,076
It can then go off and generate
longer chained

196
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,039
carbohydrates and starches,
anything that

197
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,013
has a carbon backbone.

198
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,017
So this is it.

199
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,035
This is the dark reaction.

200
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:47,030
We were able to take the
byproducts of the light

201
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,012
reactions, the ATP and the
NADHs-- there's some more ATP

202
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:54,066
there-- and use it
to fix carbon.

203
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,070
This is called carbon
fixation.

204
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,005
When you take carbon in a
gaseous form and you put it

205
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:03,088
into a solid structure, that
is called carbon fixation.

206
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:08,016
So through this Calvin Cycle we
were able to fix carbon and

207
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,020
the energy comes from these
molecules generated from the

208
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,027
light reaction.

209
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,072
And of course, it's called a
cycle because we generate

210
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,015
these PGALs, some of them can
be used to actually produce

211
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:21,058
glucose or other carbohydrates
while most of them continue on

212
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:26,025
to be recycled into ribulose
bisphosphate, which once again

213
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,091
reacts with carbon dioxide.

214
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,097
And then you get this cycle
happening over and over again.

215
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,005
Now we said it doesn't
happen in a vacuum.

216
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:35,003
Actually if you want to know the
actual location where this

217
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:39,050
is occurring, this is all
occurring in the stroma.

218
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,076
And the fluid inside the
chloroplast but outside of

219
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,095
your thylacoid.

220
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:47,012
So in your stroma, this is where
your light independent

221
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,085
reactions are actually
occurring.

222
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:54,063
And it's not just happening with
the ADP and the NADPH.

223
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:59,060
There's actually a fairly decent
sized enzyme or protein

224
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,055
that's facilitating it.

225
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,078
That's allowing the carbon
dioxide to bond at certain

226
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,089
points and the ribulose
bisphosphate and the ATP to

227
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,044
react at certain points, to
essentially drive these two

228
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,037
guys to react together.

229
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:15,055
And that enzyme, sometimes it's
called RuBisCo, I'll tell

230
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,087
you why it's called RuBisCo.

231
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,000
So this is RuBisCo.

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,069
So rub-- let me get the
capitalization right--

233
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:29,095
ribulose bisphosphate rub--
bis-- co-- carboxylase.

234
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,003
And this is what
it looks like.

235
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:34,049
So it's a pretty big protein
enzyme molecule.

236
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,071
You can imagine that you have
your ribulose bisphosphate

237
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,007
bonding at one point.

238
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,069
You have your carbon dioxide
bonding at another point.

239
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,012
I don't know what
points they are.

240
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:45,054
ATP bonds at another point.

241
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,063
It reacts.

242
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:50,039
That makes this thing twist and
turn in certain ways to

243
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,059
make the ribulose bisphosphate
react with the carbon dioxide.

244
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,046
NADPH might be reacting
at other parts.

245
00:11:57,046 --> 00:12:01,003
And that's what facilitates
this entire Calvin Cycle.

246
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:06,060
And you might-- I told you over
here-- that this R U B P,

247
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,040
this is ribulose-1
5-bisphophate.

248
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,079
This RuBisCo, this is short for
ribulose-1 5-bisphophate

249
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,028
carboxylase.

250
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,087
I won't write it all out;
you could look it up.

251
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:23,025
But it's just telling you, it's
an enzyme that's used to

252
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:28,003
react carbon and ribulose-1
5-bisphophate.

253
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:28,089
But now we're done.

254
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,075
We're done with photosynthesis.

255
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:36,007
We were able to start off with
photons and water to produce

256
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:40,010
ATP and NADPH because we had
those excited electrons, we

257
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,061
had the whole chemiosmosis to
drive the-- that allowed the

258
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,084
ATP synthase to produce ATP.

259
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,065
NADPH was the final
electron acceptor.

260
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:54,001
These are then used as the fuel
in the Calvin Cycle, in

261
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:54,099
the dark reaction.

262
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:56,082
Which is badly named, it should
be called the light

263
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,064
independent reaction.

264
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,026
Because it actually does
happen in the light.

265
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:02,007
You take your fuel from the
light reactions with some

266
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,084
carbon dioxide and you can fix
it using your-- I like to call

267
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,009
it-- the RuBisCo enzyme
in the Calvin Cycle.

268
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,021
And you end up with your
phosphoglyceraldehyde which

269
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:14,000
could also be called your
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,086
which can then be used to
generate glucose, which we all

271
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:21,039
use to eat and fuel
our bodies.

272
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,077
Or we learn in cellular
respiration, that can then be

273
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:27,054
converted into ATP
when we need it.

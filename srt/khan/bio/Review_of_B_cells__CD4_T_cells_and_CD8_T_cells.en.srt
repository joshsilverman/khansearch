1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,041


2
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:02,089
Now that we've touched on all
of the major players in the

3
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:05,083
specific immune system, what I
thought I would do in this

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:08,006
video is do a summary
so it all fits

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,050
together a little bit.

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,065
So the first person or character
we got exposed to

7
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:14,076
was the B cell, which
I always do in blue.

8
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:18,060


9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,055
And what made that interesting
is that every B cell has its

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:28,098
own specific-- or they have
membrane bound antibodies, but

11
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:33,017
for each B cell, the membrane
bound antibodies on each

12
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:36,027
specific B cell had its
own variable portion.

13
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:41,077
So this B cell-- it'll be
variable right like that.

14
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:45,003
And if I were to draw another
B cell right here, I would

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,043
draw the variable portion
a little bit different.

16
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:51,078
This is why different actual
B cells will respond to

17
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,039
different antigens or different
pathogens that have

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,064
entered our system.

19
00:00:55,064 --> 00:01:05,059
And a B cell gets activated--
let's talk about what happens

20
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,044
when it gets activated or
what needs to happen.

21
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:10,079


22
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,037
It needs binding of the pathogen
onto one of these

23
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,086
membrane bound antibodies.

24
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:28,081


25
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,089
But that's not all.

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,048
I mean, sometimes that's all you
need, but usually you also

27
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,045
need to be stimulated
by a T cell.

28
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:41,075


29
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:44,057
And you might say, where's
the helper T cell

30
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,006
stimulate this guy?

31
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,039
Well, B cells were also antigen
presenting cells so

32
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:53,001
he'll suck this guy in, break
him out, and present him on an

33
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,045
MHC II complex.

34
00:01:54,045 --> 00:02:00,029


35
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:03,040
Let's say this is an
MHC II complex.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,075
This guy gets cut up, part of
him gets presented right here,

37
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:12,050
and then an activated helper T
cell whose variable portion of

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,037
their T cell receptor is
specific to this could come

39
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:20,046
along and activate
this character.

40
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:24,031
I'm not drawing that receptor
well, but that right there is

41
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:28,034
a helper T cell and that
is the B cell.

42
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:33,028
Now, once it's activated, it
starts differentiating-- and

43
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,090
it starts cloning itself and
it can either turn into

44
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,018
effector cells-- and this true
of B cells or T cells.

45
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:43,063
Once they get activated, they
keep cloning or they either

46
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:46,053
turn into effector cells
or memory cells.

47
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:49,015
Memory cells stick around a
lot longer so that in the

48
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,056
future you're going to have
many more of this

49
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,087
version of B cells.

50
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:56,078
So if you get the same antigen
or pathogen in the future, the

51
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:59,078
likelihood of it bumping into
this type of B cell is going

52
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,069
to be higher so the response
will occur faster.

53
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:10,055
The effector B cells produce--
they essentially turn into

54
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,071
antibody making machines.

55
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:16,062
So they'll say, gee, this
antibody bonds to this antigen

56
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,056
that we have in the
system now.

57
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:20,028
Let me just produce
a ton of them.

58
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:23,015
So it starts building up all of
the cellular machinery and

59
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:26,077
it starts producing antibodies
like crazy.

60
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,030
I want to point out one thing
that my wife pointed out to me

61
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,049
when I was-- she overheard me
making the last video and

62
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,088
she's a fellow in hematology
and a lot of hematology is

63
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,056
immunology.

64
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,063
So I definitely have
to defer to her.

65
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:41,087
She is the expert on this.

66
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:45,006
In the last video, I kind of
very hand-wavingly said, B

67
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,022
cells, once they get activated,
if they're the

68
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,080
effector B cells, they
produce antibodies.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,056
I want to be very clear.

70
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,094
It is only the effector B
cells that produce the

71
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:57,056
antibodies and the common term
for them-- if someone were to

72
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,012
walk up to you and say, what
cells in the body are

73
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:02,081
producing antibodies?

74
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:05,063
You wouldn't be wrong if you
said effector B cells, but the

75
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:09,003
common term that people expect
to hear are plasma cells.

76
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:12,081


77
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:16,037
Plasma cells and effector B
cells are the same thing, but

78
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:18,098
normally when they say, what
happens to a B cell when it

79
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:20,005
starts producing antibodies?

80
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,062
They then call it
a plasma cell.

81
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:23,033
They don't call it a B cell
anymore and I want to make

82
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,086
that very clear because my
wife's like, well, I have

83
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:28,038
attendings that if they asked
me, what cell in the body

84
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:29,035
produces antibodies?

85
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,000
And if you said, B cell, they
would say, no, wrong.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,048
It's a plasma cell-- or if you
said effector B cell, they

87
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,007
wouldn't be happy.

88
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,092
They wanted to hear
plasma cell.

89
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:44,029
This is the common term used in
immunology and apparently

90
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,056
rheumatology circles.

91
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:47,029
Did I just say my wife
is a hematologist?

92
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:47,056
No, no.

93
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,076
She's studying rheumatology.

94
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:51,020
I get confused with all the
tologies sometimes.

95
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,084
Anyway, that's what
the B cells do.

96
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,025
And these antibodies can then
go attach things and mess up

97
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:58,064
viruses and antigen-- well,
viruses or instances of

98
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02,029
antigens and bacteria-- and
tag them for pick up by

99
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,064
macrophages or other types
of phagocytes.

100
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:06,038
Those were the B cells.

101
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:09,062
Then you have your T cells.

102
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:11,070
And here I'm going to talk about
T cells a little bit

103
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,031
differently than I had in
the last few videos.

104
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:18,020
Just to give a little bit more
of a nuance-- so there's two

105
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,042
types of T cells.

106
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,074
You'll say, hey, they are helper
T cells and cytotoxic T

107
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:24,070
cells-- and you're not wrong,
but what I'm going to do is do

108
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,000
a slightly different
differentiation just so that

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,060
you are familiar with these
terms. So there's

110
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,080
two types of T cells.

111
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,070
All T cells have T
cell receptors.

112
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:44,060


113
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,002
But they also have these other
proteins on them and some of

114
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:58,019
them have these proteins
called-- CD4 proteins and some

115
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:04,058
of them have what's
called CD8.

116
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:09,052


117
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,043
So this one right here
would be called a

118
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:15,054
CD8 positive T cell.

119
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,027
It has the CD8 proteins on it.

120
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:23,076
And this would be called
a CD4 positive T cell.

121
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:25,031
I've never used these
words before.

122
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,025
You're like, gee, where
are these coming from?

123
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:32,017
Now, the CD4 receptor is the
thing that wants to bind--

124
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:38,075
this is the thing that helps to
go to the MHC II complexes.

125
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:45,067
So most CD4 T cells are
helper T cells.

126
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,045
Most of the time-- and I want
to make it very clear--

127
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,093
immunology is a very-- I mean,
this field, people are

128
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:51,056
discovering things on
a regular basis.

129
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:53,045
So people are still
understanding these things and

130
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:57,006
there's all sorts of special
cases, but usually when people

131
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,027
talk about CD4 positive T cells,
they're talking about

132
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,002
helper T cells.

133
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:07,075
So this is normally going to
be a helper T cell-- or you

134
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,043
could call it T helper,
just like that.

135
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:13,082
Likewise, the CD8 proteins,
these are attracted

136
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:15,081
to the MHC I complex.

137
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:21,033


138
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:24,048
This is what brings them to
the cells that have the

139
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,099
cancer, that have expressed
antigens

140
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,098
on their MHC I complex.

141
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:30,093
So most of the time CD8

142
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:33,006
positive T cells are cytotoxic.

143
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:39,050


144
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,017
And oftentimes, before a cell
gets activated, they just

145
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:45,088
describe it as a CD4 T cell
or a CD8 cell and after it

146
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:53,024
becomes activated and starts
wanting to kill things, then

147
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,039
maybe you call it cytotoxic.

148
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,038
But this is all wordplay.

149
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,068
I think you get the
general idea.

150
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:04,017
But just to remember what they
do, this guy-- we just said he

151
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:08,051
wants to bond to the MHC
complex, so you have MHC

152
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:13,057
complex plus presenting
some antigen.

153
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:15,083
This is MHC I right here.

154
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:19,007
We learned in the last video,
every nucleated cell in the

155
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:22,087
body expresses an
MHC I complex.

156
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,025
So this is the case where
something wacky is happening

157
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,050
inside this cell.

158
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,006
Maybe a virus has infected it.

159
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,020
Maybe it's cancerous.

160
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,090
It needs to die, otherwise it's
going to keep producing

161
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,023
viruses if it's infected by a
virus, or otherwise it's going

162
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:39,036
to keep dividing if it's
a cancer and infect

163
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:40,032
the rest of the body.

164
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:45,036
So the CD8 kills
infected cells.

165
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:48,071
I'll just say bad cells because
I don't if you can--

166
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,021
cancer really isn't
an infection.

167
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:53,044
Kills bad cells-- cells that
are-- if you don't kill them,

168
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,096
they're going to keep producing
viruses or keep

169
00:08:54,096 --> 00:09:00,011
splitting and spreading the
cancer, while T cells--

170
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,008
they're attracted to
professional antigen

171
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,046
presenting cells.

172
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,095
And I always do a dendritic cell
right here because those

173
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:09,036
are the best antigen
presenting cells.

174
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:16,086
And they have MHC II complexes
and it's digested some antigen

175
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:21,001
and it presents it right there
and then that activates the

176
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,020
helper T cell.

177
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,080
And then when the helper T
cell-- all of these guys, once

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,062
they're activated, they all go
into effector-- they all start

179
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:35,069
differentiating into effector
and memory cells.

180
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:40,063
An effector helper T cell
does a couple of things.

181
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:46,084
So if we're talking about a
helper T cell, it can activate

182
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:51,097
B cells and it also releases
cytokines.

183
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:53,008
Let's say this guy
gets activated.

184
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:56,002
He'll also start releasing these
chemicals, which are

185
00:09:56,002 --> 00:10:00,000
really those alarm bells that
tell other people to really

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,085
get in gear-- maybe B cells and
cytotoxic T cells start

187
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,042
proliferating more rigorously.

188
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:10,073
Actually, part of the cytotoxic
T cell activation

189
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:14,069
can be assisted or kind of
given a boost by these

190
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:17,090
cytokines-- of so by
these alarm bells.

191
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:24,050
So this guy's the alarm ringer,
while the CD8 cells or

192
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,057
the cytotoxic T cells--
in their effector

193
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:31,022
mode, they kill cells.

194
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,059
And of course in the memory
mode, there's just a bunch of

195
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,045
copies of these originals around
that are ready and more

196
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:39,012
than they were originally were,
so that in the future if

197
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,073
something like this or something
like this occurs,

198
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,050
they're going to be activated
faster because they're going

199
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,014
to be bumped into faster.

200
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,021
So hopefully that clears up a
little bit and I introduced a

201
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,092
little bit more tough
terminology, but I really want

202
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,075
to stress my wife's point
because she said, hey, you

203
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:53,055
don't want people out there
saying B cells produce

204
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,009
antibodies even though it is
effector B cells-- activated B

205
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,034
cells that have differentiated
into effector B cells.

206
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,067
Those are what are producing
antibodies-- because when they

207
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,057
go to medical school, people
are going to want to hear

208
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,055
plasma cell.

209
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,023

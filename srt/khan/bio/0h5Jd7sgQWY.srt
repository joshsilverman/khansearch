1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:03,020
Considerando que eu tenho um resfriado
agora, eu não posso imaginar um

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,010
tópico mais apropriado para fazer um vídeo em que um vírus.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,092
E eu não queria
torná-lo que de espessura.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,038
A virus, or viruses.

5
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:14,075


6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:19,007
And in my opinion, viruses are,
on some level, the most

7
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:21,044
fascinating thing in
all of biology.

8
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:25,055
Because they really blur the
boundary between what is an

9
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,044
inanimate object and
what is life?

10
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:30,007


11
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,040
I mean if we look at ourselves,
or life as one of

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,021
those things that you know
it when you see it.

13
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:39,029
If you see something that,
it's born, it grows, it's

14
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,046
constantly changing.

15
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:41,050
Maybe it moves around.

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,025
Maybe it doesn't.

17
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:44,039
But it's metabolizing things
around itself.

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,031
It reproduces and
then it dies.

19
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:48,029
You say, hey, that's
probably life.

20
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:50,096
And in this, we throw most
things that we see-- or we

21
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,081
throw in, us.

22
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:55,035
We throw in bacteria.

23
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:57,011
We throw in plants.

24
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:00,082
I mean, I could-- I'm kind of
butchering the taxonomy system

25
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:03,027
here, but we tend to know
life when we see it.

26
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:07,048
But all viruses are, they're
just a bunch of genetic

27
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:09,073
information inside
of a protein.

28
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:11,023
Inside of a protein capsule.

29
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:13,048
So let me draw.

30
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:16,034
And the genetic information
can come in any form.

31
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:22,023
So it can be an RNA, it could
be DNA, it could be

32
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,067
single-stranded RNA,
double-stranded RNA.

33
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:27,026
Sometimes for single stranded
they'll write these two little

34
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:29,025
S's in front of it.

35
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:30,095
Let's say they are talking about
double stranded DNA,

36
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:32,090
they'll put a ds
in front of it.

37
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,032
But the general idea-- and
viruses can come in all of

38
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:38,010
these forms-- is that they have
some genetic information,

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,053
some chain of nucleic acids.

40
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:43,073
Either as single or double
stranded RNA or single or

41
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,056
double stranded DNA.

42
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:47,096
And it's just contained inside
some type of protein

43
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,087
structure, which is
called the capsid.

44
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:53,023
And kind of the classic
drawing is kind of an

45
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:56,065
icosahedron type
looking thing.

46
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,020
Let me see if I can
do justice to it.

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,060
It looks something like this.

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,079
And not all viruses have to
look exactly like this.

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,015
There's thousands of
types of viruses.

50
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:06,084
And we're really just scratching
the surface and

51
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,062
understanding even what viruses
are out there and all

52
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:14,080
of the different ways that they
can essentially replicate

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,021
themselves.

54
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,062
We'll talk more about
that in the future.

55
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:19,011
And I would suspect that pretty
much any possible way

56
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:21,053
of replication probably
does somehow exist

57
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,075
in the virus world.

58
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,025
But they really are just these
proteins, these protein

59
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,044
capsids, are just made up
of a bunch of little

60
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:29,006
proteins put together.

61
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,025
And inside they have some
genetic material, which might

62
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,069
be DNA or it might be RNA.

63
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,087
So let me draw their
genetic material.

64
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,041
The protein is not necessarily
transparent, but if it was,

65
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,096
you would see some genetic
material inside of there.

66
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:48,043
So the question is, is
this thing life?

67
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,058
It seems pretty inanimate.

68
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:50,053
It doesn't grow.

69
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,050
It doesn't change.

70
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,019
It doesn't metabolize things.

71
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,019
This thing, left to its
own devices, is just

72
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:55,084
going to sit there.

73
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:59,059
It's just going to sit there the
way a book on a table just

74
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,068
sits there.

75
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,028
It won't change anything.

76
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:06,056
But what happens is,
the debate arises.

77
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,046
I mean you might say, hey Sal,
when you define it that way,

78
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,068
just looks like a bunch of
molecules put together.

79
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,074
That isn't life.

80
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,034
But it starts to seem like life
all of a sudden when it

81
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:17,009
comes in contact with the
things that we normally

82
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,021
consider life.

83
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:22,047
So what viruses do, the classic
example is, a virus

84
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,068
will attach itself to a cell.

85
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:28,059
So let me draw this thing
a little bit smaller.

86
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,025
So let's say that this
is my virus.

87
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,056
I'll draw it as a
little hexagon.

88
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:34,097
And what it does is, it'll
attach itself to a cell.

89
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,079
And it could be any
type of cell.

90
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,015
It could be a bacteria cell, it
could be a plant cell, it

91
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,018
could be a human cell.

92
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:43,081
Let me draw the cell here.

93
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:48,053
Cells are usually far larger
than the virus.

94
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:51,061
In the case of cells that have
soft membranes, the virus

95
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:53,084
figures out some way
to enter it.

96
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:58,078
Sometimes it can essentially
fuse-- I don't want to

97
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:01,038
complicate the issue-- but
sometimes viruses have their

98
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,047
own little membranes.

99
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:03,074
And we'll talk about
in a second where

100
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:04,075
it gets their membranes.

101
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:08,027
So a virus might have its
own membrane like that.

102
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:10,052
That's around its capsid.

103
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:13,046
And then these membranes
will fuse.

104
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:16,078
And then the virus will be able
to enter into the cell.

105
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, that's one method.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,067
And another method,
and they're seldom

107
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,058
all the same way.

108
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:24,001
But let's say another method
would be, the virus

109
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,091
convinces-- just based on some
protein receptors on it, or

110
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:29,081
protein receptors on the cells--
and obviously this has

111
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:31,064
to be kind of a Trojan
horse type of thing.

112
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,060
The cell doesn't want viruses.

113
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,038
So the virus has to somehow
convince the cell that it's a

114
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:38,005
non-foreign particle.

115
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:41,076
We could do hundreds of videos
on how viruses work and it's a

116
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:43,043
continuing field of research.

117
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:47,057
But sometimes you might have a
virus that just gets consumed

118
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:48,012
by the cell.

119
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,093
Maybe the cell just thinks it's
something that it needs

120
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,095
to consume.

121
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:53,012
So the cell wraps around
it like this.

122
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:56,077


123
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,093
And these sides will
eventually merge.

124
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,067
And then the cell and the
virus will go into it.

125
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,016
This is called endocytosis.

126
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,001
I'll just talk about that.

127
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,063
It just brings it into
its cytoplasm.

128
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:11,001
It doesn't happen
just to viruses.

129
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,088
But this is one mechanism
that can enter.

130
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:17,031
And then in cases where the cell
in question-- for example

131
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:20,027
in the situation with bacteria--
if the cell has a

132
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:25,051
very hard shell-- let me
do it in a good color.

133
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:29,004
So let's say that this is
a bacteria right here.

134
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,050
And it has a hard shell.

135
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,082
The viruses don't even
enter the cell.

136
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:36,043
They just hang out outside
of the cell like this.

137
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,074
Not drawing to scale.

138
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:40,068
And they actually inject
their genetic material.

139
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:43,079
So there's obviously a huge--
there's a wide variety of ways

140
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,068
of how the viruses
get into cells.

141
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:46,077
But that's beside the point.

142
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:49,042
The interesting thing is that
they do get into the cell.

143
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:52,024
And once they do get into the
cell, they release their

144
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,056
genetic material
into the cell.

145
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,097
So their genetic material
will float around.

146
00:05:56,097 --> 00:06:01,038
If their genetic material is
already in the form of RNA--

147
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,069
and I could imagine almost every
possibility of different

148
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,016
ways for viruses to work
probably do exist in nature.

149
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,039
We just haven't found them.

150
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,062
But the ones that we've already
found really do kind

151
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:13,087
of do it in every
possible way.

152
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:20,072
So if they have RNA, this RNA
can immediately start being

153
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:23,017
used to essentially-- let's
say this is the

154
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:25,054
nucleus of the cell.

155
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:28,085
That's the nucleus of the cell
and it normally has the DNA in

156
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,048
it like that.

157
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,072
Maybe I'll do the DNA in
a different color.

158
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:37,025
But DNA gets transcribed
into RNA, normally.

159
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:39,093
So normally, the cell, this a
normal working cell, the RNA

160
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:43,054
exits the nucleus, it goes to
the ribosomes, and then you

161
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:46,068
have the RNA in conjunction with
the tRNA and it produces

162
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:49,025
these proteins.

163
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:51,002
The RNA codes for different
proteins.

164
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:53,067
And I talk about that in
a different video.

165
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:57,000
So these proteins get formed and
eventually, they can form

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
the different structures
in a cell.

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,018
But what a virus does is it
hijacks this process here.

168
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,049
Hijacks this mechanism.

169
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,055
This RNA will essentially go and
do what the cell's own RNA

170
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,023
would have done.

171
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:11,013
And it starts coding for
its own proteins.

172
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,025
Obviously it's not
going to code for

173
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:13,025
the same things there.

174
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,079
And actually some of the first
proteins it codes for often

175
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,067
start killing the DNA and the
RNA that might otherwise

176
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,037
compete with it.

177
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:22,038
So it codes its own proteins.

178
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,086
And then those proteins start
making more viral shells.

179
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:31,051
So those proteins just start
constructing more and more

180
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,083
viral shells.

181
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,000
At the same time, this
RNA is replicating.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,073
It's using the cell's own
mechanisms. Left to its own

183
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:40,081
devices it would
just sit there.

184
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:43,080
But once it enters into a cell
it can use all of the nice

185
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,000
machinery that a cell has around
to replicate itself.

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,036
And it's kind of amazing, just
the biochemistry of it.

187
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,081
That these RNA molecules
then find themselves

188
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:57,047
back in these capsids.

189
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:00,029
And then once there's enough
of these and the cell has

190
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:05,062
essentially all of its resources
have been depleted,

191
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:09,099
the viruses, these individual
new viruses that have

192
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:15,041
replicated themselves using all
of the cell's mechanisms,

193
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,037
will find some way
to exit the cell.

194
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:20,086
The most-- I don't want to
say, typical, because we

195
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:23,011
haven't even discovered all the
different types of viruses

196
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:26,075
there are-- but one that's, I
guess, talked about the most,

197
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,075
is when there's enough of
these, they'll release

198
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,087
proteins or they'll construct
proteins.

199
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,038
Because they don't
make their own.

200
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,086
That essentially cause the cell
to either kill itself or

201
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,013
its membrane to dissolve.

202
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,025
So the membrane dissolves.

203
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:41,048
And essentially the
cell lyses.

204
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,040
Let me write that down.

205
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,084
The cell lyses.

206
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:46,011
And lyses just means that
the cell's membrane just

207
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:46,089
disappears.

208
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,048
And then all of these guys can
emerge for themselves.

209
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:53,047
Now I talked about before that
have some of these guys, that

210
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,075
they have their own membrane.

211
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,071
So how did they get
there, these

212
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:58,039
kind of bilipid membranes?

213
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,089
Well some of them, what they
do is, once they replicate

214
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:07,037
inside of a cell, they exit
maybe not even killing-- they

215
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,064
don't have to lyse.

216
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,062
Everything I talk about, these
are specific ways that a virus

217
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:12,014
might work.

218
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:15,062
But viruses really kind of
explore-- well different types

219
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,062
of viruses do almost every
different combination you

220
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:22,061
could imagine of replicating
and coding for proteins and

221
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,039
escaping from cells.

222
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,072
Some of them just bud.

223
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:26,055
And when they bud, they
essentially, you can kind of

224
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,007
imagine that they push
against the cell

225
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:29,066
wall, or the membrane.

226
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,074
I shouldn't say cell wall.

227
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:32,062
The cell's outer membrane.

228
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:36,012
And then when they push against
it, they take some of

229
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:38,007
the membrane with them.

230
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:41,025
Until eventually the cell
will-- when this goes up

231
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,080
enough, this'll pop together
and it'll take some of the

232
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,056
membrane with it.

233
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:47,027
And you could imagine why that
would be useful thing

234
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,002
to have with you.

235
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,025
Because now that you have this
membrane, you kind of look

236
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,051
like this cell.

237
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,029
So when you want to go infect
another cell like this, you're

238
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,052
not going to necessarily look
like a foreign particle.

239
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:02,077
So it's a very useful way to
look like something that

240
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:03,047
you're not.

241
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:06,094
And if you don't think that this
is creepy-crawly enough,

242
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:10,077
that you're hijacking the DNA
of an organism, viruses can

243
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:14,074
actually change the
DNA an organism.

244
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:18,083
And actually one of the most
common examples is HIV virus.

245
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,048
Let me write that down.

246
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:27,048
HIV, which is a type of
retrovirus, which is

247
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:28,027
fascinating.

248
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,092
Because what they do is, so
they have RNA in them.

249
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:35,080


250
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,002
And when they enter into a cell,
let's say that they got

251
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:39,042
into the cell.

252
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,095
So it's inside of the
cell like this.

253
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:46,057
They actually bring along
with them a protein.

254
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:49,060
And every time you say, where
do they get this protein?

255
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,038
All of this stuff came from
a different cell.

256
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:54,049
They use some other cell's amino
acids and ribosomes and

257
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,079
nucleic acids and everything
to build themselves.

258
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,077
So any proteins that they
have in them came

259
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,008
from another cell.

260
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:04,061
But they bring with them, this
protein reverse transcriptase.

261
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,085
And the reverse transcriptase
takes their RNA and

262
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:11,049
codes it into DNA.

263
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:14,078
So its RNA to DNA.

264
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:16,080
Which when it was first
discovered was, kind of,

265
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,095
people always thought that you
always went from DNA to RNA,

266
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,011
but this kind of broke
that paradigm.

267
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,085
But it codes from RNA to DNA.

268
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:29,001
And if that's not bad enough,
it'll incorporate that DNA

269
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,035
into the DNA of the host cell.

270
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,050
So that DNA will incorporate
itself into the

271
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,020
DNA of the host cell.

272
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,069
Let's say the yellow is the
DNA of the host cell.

273
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:41,000
And this is its nucleus.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,007
So it actually messes with
the genetic makeup

275
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,002
of what it's infecting.

276
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:51,057
And when I made the videos on
bacteria I said, hey for every

277
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:53,078
one human cell we have twenty
bacteria cells.

278
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,041
And they live with us and
they're useful and they're

279
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:00,010
part of us and they're 10% of
our dry mass and all of that.

280
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,016
But bacteria are kind of
along for the ride.

281
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,086
They don't change who we are.

282
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:07,000
But these retroviruses, they're
actually changing our

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,094
genetic makeup.

284
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,064
I mean, my genes, I take
very personally.

285
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,037
They define who I am.

286
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:14,062
But these guys will
actually go in and

287
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,024
change my genetic makeup.

288
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:19,029
And then once they're part of
the DNA, then just the natural

289
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:25,033
DNA to RNA to protein
process will code

290
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,017
their actual proteins.

291
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:30,015
Or their-- what they need to--
so sometimes they'll lay

292
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,041
dormant and do nothing.

293
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,073
And sometimes-- let's say
sometimes in some type of

294
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,078
environmental trigger,
they'll start coding

295
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,011
for themselves again.

296
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,062
And they'll start
producing more.

297
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:41,098
But they're producing it
directly from the organism's

298
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:43,011
cell's DNA.

299
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,012
They become part of
the organism.

300
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:49,027
I mean I can't imagine a more
intimate way to become part of

301
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:51,052
an organism than to become
part of its DNA.

302
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:52,087
I can't imagine any
other way to

303
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,067
actually define an organism.

304
00:12:55,067 --> 00:13:00,090
And if this by itself is not
eerie enough, and just so you

305
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,076
know, this notion right here,
when a virus becomes part of

306
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,042
an organism's DNA, this
is called a provirus.

307
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:13,017


308
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:16,088
But if this isn't eerie enough,
they estimate-- so if

309
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:23,050
this infects a cell in my nose
or in my arm, as this cell

310
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,025
experiences mitosis, all of
its offspring-- but its

311
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,002
offspring are genetically
identical-- are going to have

312
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,060
this viral DNA.

313
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,005
And that might be fine,
but at least my

314
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,012
children won't get it.

315
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,098
You know, at least it won't
become part of my species.

316
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:38,071
But it doesn't have to just
infect somatic cells, it could

317
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:41,016
infect a germ cell.

318
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:44,050
So it could go into
a germ cell.

319
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,085
And the germ cells, we've
learned already, these are the

320
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:49,037
ones that produce gametes.

321
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,092
For men, that's sperm and
for women it's eggs.

322
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:55,017
But you could imagine, once
you've infected a germ cell,

323
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:59,000
once you become part of a germ
cell's DNA, then I'm passing

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,060
on that viral DNA to my
son or my daughter.

325
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,053
And they are going to pass
it on to their children.

326
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:10,025
And just that idea by itself
is, at least to my mind.

327
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,012
vaguely creepy.

328
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:16,004
And people estimate that 5-8%--
and this kind of really

329
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:19,048
blurs, it makes you think about
what we as humans really

330
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:26,079
are-- but the estimate is 5-8%
of the human genome-- so when

331
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,050
I talked about bacteria I just
talked about things that were

332
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,085
along for the ride.

333
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:33,024
But the current estimate, and
I looked up this a lot.

334
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,021
I found 8% someplace,
5% someplace.

335
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:35,099
It's all a guess.

336
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,064
I mean people are doing it based
on just looking at the

337
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:40,069
DNA and how similar it is to
DNA in other organisms. But

338
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:47,038
the estimate is 5-8% of the
human genome is from viruses,

339
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:51,075
is from ancient retroviruses
that incorporated themselves

340
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:53,052
into the human germ line.

341
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:55,072
So into the human DNA.

342
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:57,086
So these are called endogenous
retroviruses.

343
00:14:57,086 --> 00:15:04,079


344
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,014
Which is mind blowing to me,
because it's not just saying

345
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,028
these things are along for the
ride or that they might help

346
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,007
us or hurt us.

347
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:14,000
It's saying that we are--
5-8% of our DNA

348
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,038
actually comes from viruses.

349
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:17,085
And this is another thing
that speaks to

350
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,072
just genetic variation.

351
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:24,021
Because viruses do something--
I mean this is called

352
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:27,075
horizontal transfer of DNA.

353
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:30,048
And you could imagine, as a
virus goes from one species to

354
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:37,022
the next, as it goes from
Species A to B, if it mutates

355
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:41,030
to be able to infiltrate these
cells, it might take some--

356
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,080
it'll take the DNA that
it already has, that

357
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,049
makes it, it with it.

358
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,017
But sometimes, when it starts
coding for some of these other

359
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:52,083
guys, so let's say that this
is a provirus right here.

360
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,086
Where the blue part is
the original virus.

361
00:15:55,086 --> 00:16:00,096
The yellow is the organism's
historic DNA.

362
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:04,023
Sometimes when it codes, it
takes up little sections of

363
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:07,020
the other organism's DNA.

364
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,080
So maybe most of it was the
viral DNA, but it might have,

365
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,007
when it transcribed and
translated itself, it might

366
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,071
have taken a little bit-- or at
least when it translated or

367
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,046
replicated itself-- it might
take a little bit of the

368
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,053
organism's previous DNA.

369
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:23,069
So it's actually cutting parts
of DNA from one organism and

370
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:24,095
bringing it to another
organism.

371
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:27,049
Taking it from one member of a
species to another member of

372
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:27,080
the species.

373
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,075
But it can definitely
go cross-species.

374
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,086
So you have this idea all of
a sudden that DNA can jump

375
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,009
between species.

376
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,040
It really kind of-- I don't
know, for me it makes me

377
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,092
appreciate how interconnected--
as a species,

378
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,095
we kind of imagine that we're
by ourselves and can only

379
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:45,011
reproduce with each other and
have genetic variation within

380
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:45,086
a population.

381
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:50,019
But viruses introduce this
notion of horizontal transfer

382
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:53,009
via transduction.

383
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,063
Horizontal transduction is just
the idea of, look when I

384
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:00,065
replicate this virus, I might
take a little bit of the

385
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:04,034
organism that I'm freeloading
off of, I might take a little

386
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:06,000
bit of their DNA with me.

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,016
And infect that DNA into
the next organism.

388
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,032
So you actually have this
DNA, this jumping,

389
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:13,011
from organism to organism.

390
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,029
So it kind of unifies
all DNA-based life.

391
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:20,060
Which is all the life that
we know on the planet.

392
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,090
And if all of this isn't creepy
enough-- and actually

393
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:28,053
maybe I'll save the creepiest
part for the end.

394
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,079
But there's a whole-- we could
talk all about the different

395
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,067
classes of viruses.

396
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,080
But just so you're familiar with
some of the terminology,

397
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,089
when a virus attacks bacteria,
which they often do.

398
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,015
And we study these the most
because this might be a good

399
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:42,063
alternative to antibiotics.

400
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:45,043
Because viruses that attack
bacteria might-- sometimes the

401
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,081
bacteria is far worse for the
virus-- but these are called

402
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:49,006
bacteriaphages.

403
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:52,060


404
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,031
And I've already talked to you
about how they have their DNA.

405
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:57,089
But since bacteria have hard
walls, they will just inject

406
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:00,094
the DNA inside of
the bacteria.

407
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:06,063
And when you talk about DNA,
this idea of a provirus.

408
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:09,017
So when a virus lyses it
like this, this is

409
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,008
called the lytic cycle.

410
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,075
This is just some terminology
that's good to know if you're

411
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,025
going to take a biology
exam about this stuff.

412
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,059
And when the virus incorporates
it into the DNA

413
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,034
and lays dormant, incorporates
into the DNA of the host

414
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,042
organism and lays dormant for
awhile, this is called the

415
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:28,002
lysogenic cycle.

416
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:32,002
And normally, a provirus is
essentially experiencing a

417
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:35,091
lysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes,
in organisms that

418
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:38,025
have a nuclear membrane.

419
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,089
Normally when people talk about
the lysogenic cycle,

420
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:44,075
they're talking about viral DNA
laying dormant in the DNA

421
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,059
of bacteria.

422
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,059
Or bacteriophage DNA
laying dormant

423
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,004
in the DNA of bacteria.

424
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,038
But just to kind of give you
an idea of what this, quote

425
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:59,048
unquote, looks like,
right here.

426
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:01,054
I got these two pictures
from Wikipedia.

427
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:02,079
One is from the CDC.

428
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:11,035


429
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:14,020
These little green dots you see
right here all over the

430
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,053
surface, this big thing you
see here, this is a white

431
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:20,032
blood cell.

432
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,075
Part of the human
immune system.

433
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,004
This is a white blood cell.

434
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:27,053


435
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:31,005
And what you see emerging from
the surface, essentially

436
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,050
budding from the surface of this
white blood cell-- and

437
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,029
this gives you a sense
of scale too--

438
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,070
these are HIV-1 viruses.

439
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:46,097
And so you're familiar with the
terminology, the HIV is a

440
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:51,080
virus that infects white
blood cells.

441
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,089
AIDS is the syndrome you get
once your immune system is

442
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:55,090
weakened to the point.

443
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,085
And then many people suffer
infections that people with a

444
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:01,045
strong immune system normally
won't suffer from.

445
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:03,004
But this is creepy.

446
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:06,035
These things went inside this
huge cell, they used the

447
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:11,055
cell's own mechanism to
reproduce its own DNA or its

448
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,029
own RNA and these
protein capsids.

449
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,026
And then they bud from the cell
and take a little bit of

450
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,049
the membrane with it.

451
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,099
And they can even leave some
of their DNA behind in this

452
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,033
cell's own DNA.

453
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:25,027
So they really change what
the cell is all about.

454
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:26,089
This is another creepy
picture.

455
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,014
These are bacteriaphages.

456
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:34,050


457
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,010
And these show you what
I said before.

458
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,045
This is a bacteria right here.

459
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:41,035
This is its cell wall.

460
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:42,009
And it's hard.

461
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,001
So it's hard to just
emerge into it.

462
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,003
Or you can't just merge,
fuse membranes with it.

463
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:52,028
So they hang out on the outside
of this bacteria.

464
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:55,041
And they are essentially
injecting their genetic

465
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,027
material into the
bacteria itself.

466
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,089
And you could imagine,
just looking at the

467
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,000
size of these things.

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,008
I mean, this is a cell.

469
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,034
And it looks like a whole
planet or something.

470
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,065
Or this is a bacteria and these

471
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,061
things are so much smaller.

472
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:08,017
Roughly 1/100 of a bacteria.

473
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,056
And these are much less than
1/100 of this cell we're

474
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,010
talking about.

475
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,050
And they're extremely
hard to filter for.

476
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,051
To kind of keep out.

477
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:20,077
Because they are such,
such small particles.

478
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,028
If you think that these are
exotic things that exist for

479
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:31,035
things like HIV or Ebola , which
they do cause, or SARS,

480
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:32,033
you're right.

481
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,073
But they're also
common things.

482
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:35,049
I mean, I said at the beginning
of this video that I

483
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,029
have a cold.

484
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:40,003
And I have a cold because some
viruses have infected the

485
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,060
tissue in my nasal passage.

486
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,019
And they're causing me to have
a runny nose and whatnot.

487
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,053
And viruses also cause
the chicken pox.

488
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,054
They cause the herpes
simplex virus.

489
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,053
Causes cold sores.

490
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:53,043
So they're with us all around.

491
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:56,000
I can almost guarantee
you have some virus

492
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,074
with you as you speak.

493
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:58,063
They're all around you.

494
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:04,031
But it's a very

495
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,048
philosophically puzzling question.

496
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:09,008
Because I started with, at the
beginning, are these life?

497
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:11,049
And at first when I just showed
it to you, look they

498
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,074
are just this protein
with some nucleic

499
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:15,027
acid molecule in it.

500
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:16,033
And it's not doing anything.

501
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,077
And that doesn't look
like life to me.

502
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,060
It's not moving around.

503
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,066
It doesn't have a metabolism.

504
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,039
It's not eating.

505
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,055
It's not reproducing.

506
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:23,011
But then all of a sudden, when
you think about what it's

507
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:27,013
doing to cells and how it uses
cells to kind of reproduce.

508
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,070
It kind of like-- in business
terms it's asset light.

509
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,092
It doesn't need all of the
machinery because it can use

510
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:35,084
other people's machinery
to replicate itself.

511
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:38,007
You almost kind of want
to view it as a

512
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,051
smarter form of life.

513
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,048
Because it doesn't go through
all of the trouble of what

514
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:44,010
every other form of life has.

515
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,056
It makes you question what life
is, or even what we are.

516
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:51,050
Are we these things that contain
DNA or are we just

517
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,017
transport mechanisms
for the DNA?

518
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:56,025
And these are kind of the
more important things.

519
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:59,071
And these viral infections are
just battles between different

520
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:02,033
forms of DNA and RNA
and whatnot.

521
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:04,032
Anyway I don't want to get
too philosophical on you.

522
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:08,083
But hopefully this gives you a
good idea of what viruses are

523
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:12,094
and why they really are, in my
mind, the most fascinating

524
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:15,086
pseudo organism in
all of biology.

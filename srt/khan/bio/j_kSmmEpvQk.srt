1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,027


2
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:02,074
In the very first immunology
video, where we talked about

3
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:05,058
nonspecific defense mechanisms,
we said if we had

4
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:09,040
some type of a pathogen-- let's
say it's a bacteria--

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,003
that our phagocytes can
recognize either proteins on

6
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:16,076
the bacteria or maybe it was
some other type of pathogen--

7
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:18,009
some other marker
on the pathogen.

8
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:20,078
It doesn't know what type of
pathogen it is, but that's

9
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:23,082
enough for the phagocyte.

10
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:25,017
It'll engulf the pathogen.

11
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:28,021
So let's say this is
the phagocyte.

12
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,006
Somehow one of their receptors
touches one of the proteins

13
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:36,056
that's on the surface of this
bacteria in this case and

14
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:38,079
says, gee, that's not a good
thing to have around and so

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,052
it'll engulf it.

16
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:44,082
So the membrane is just going to
surround the pathogen-- and

17
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:46,006
this part is going to go in.

18
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,043
It's going to kind of pinch in
and the pathogen is going to

19
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,028
get surrounded and
get engulfed--

20
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:53,057
phagocytozed by the phagocyte.

21
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:56,090
So the end product-- we saw this
on the first video where

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,052
I talked about phagocytes-- is
we're going to end up-- so

23
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:02,015
then the membrane's going
to be completely around.

24
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:05,034
This is going to pinch in and
bubble around this thing and

25
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:08,096
so we're going to have
the pathogen sitting

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,009
inside of the phagocyte.

27
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,068
It's going to be surrounded
by a membrane.

28
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:16,021
That membrane's called
a phagosome.

29
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:17,056
And we learned there's
different types of

30
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:22,037
phagocytes-- could be a
macrophage, could be a

31
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:28,028
neutrophil, could be a dendritic
cell-- and we have

32
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,025
it like this and then we also
saw in that video, it's not

33
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,045
just done-- the macrophage
doesn't

34
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:34,039
just digest this thing.

35
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,096
That by itself is very useful.

36
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,015
It got this bacteria
out of the way.

37
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,084
If this was a virus, it got
that virus out of the way.

38
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:42,056
But it does even
more than that.

39
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:45,084
It takes that and then it lyses
it-- or it breaks it up.

40
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:50,070
It doesn't have to actually
use-- well, it breaks it up.

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,043
There's several ways it can do
it, but the bottom line is, it

42
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:54,068
processes it.

43
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:58,001


44
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,093
It'll break up the pathogen--
and we saw that first video on

45
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:05,081
phagocytes that we'll actually
have a lysosome bond to it and

46
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,000
dump all sorts of particles that
are going to break up and

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,081
cut up this bacteria,
in this case, into

48
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:12,006
its constituent molecules.

49
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:18,000


50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,025
And then some subset of the
leftovers, particular chains

51
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:27,006
of the peptides-- and remember,
proteins are long

52
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:28,058
chains of amino acids.

53
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:30,061
Polypeptides are short chains.

54
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,093
So you take short chains of
those and they're going to

55
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,056
bond to special proteins.

56
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:37,031


57
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,080
And this is essentially the
topic of this video.

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,034
So let's say they bond to that
special protein, bond to that

59
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,040
special protein.

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,019
And then those proteins get
transported or get to the

61
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,091
membrane or the outer surface
of the cell and they present

62
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:53,075
themselves along with the
piece of the pathogen.

63
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:57,041
So the end product after
phagocytozed this pathogen is

64
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:01,080
that the phagocyte will look
something like this and it

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,031
will have these antigen
presenting proteins, I guess

66
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,008
we can call them, that had
bound to parts of that

67
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,087
original pathogen.

68
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:16,080
Let me do it right here.

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,006
So it has a little bit of the
original pathogen on it that I

70
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:23,000
drew in green right here.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,081
And these proteins right here,
these are called-- it's a

72
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,012
fancy word and I talked about
it in the previous video--

73
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:47,013
these are called major
histocompatibility complexes,

74
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:53,016
or MHC for short.

75
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:58,016
And when we're talking about
phagocytes or macrophages or

76
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:00,027
dendritic cells that are
particular cases of

77
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:03,059
phagocytes, the major
histocompatibility complexes

78
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,069
that they present after
they've digested this

79
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,037
molecule-- this is
an MHC class II.

80
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:11,062
Let me write this down.

81
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:16,025
This is an MHC class
II protein.

82
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,089
It might seem like I'm really
going into the minutiae of

83
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,087
what these proteins are, but
we're going to see this is key

84
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:25,018
for activating other parts of
the immune system, especially

85
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,044
the cell mediated parts
of the immune system.

86
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:30,062
So this was the case with a
macrophage or a dendrite.

87
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,025
They engulf something, they chew
it all up, and then parts

88
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,086
of the chewed up thing that they
ate, they attach to these

89
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:41,069
MHC II proteins and these
MHC proteins go to the

90
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:42,074
surface of the cell.

91
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,001
The same thing-- or actually not
the quite the same thing--

92
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:49,002
a very similar thing happens
with B cells.

93
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:52,081
So if we have a B cell--
that's a good color.

94
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,089
B for blue.

95
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:57,058
We know B stands for bursa, but
it could stand for bone

96
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:58,093
marrow just as well.

97
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:02,056
Let's say we have a B cell and
it's got its membrane bound

98
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,091
antibody on it.

99
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:07,044
Remember, it's very specific
to that B cells.

100
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:10,091
So all of the membrane bound
antibodies, all 10,000 or so

101
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:14,050
of them on this B cell, they
all expressed the same

102
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,092
variable part.

103
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:18,072
So this is a particular
B cell.

104
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:20,068
So remember, this
was nonspecific.

105
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:23,044
When we talked about
phagocytosis, these guys just

106
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,043
say, you're a bacteria.

107
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:24,098
You're a virus.

108
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:25,093
I don't know what
kind you are.

109
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,082
I'm just going to eat you up.

110
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:27,043
You look shady.

111
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,013
I'm going to eat you up.

112
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,043
I don't know what type
you are or whether

113
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:30,041
I've seen you before.

114
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,054
When we're talking about B
cells, we're talking about the

115
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:35,007
adaptive or the specific
immune system.

116
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:39,018
And so these-- the variable ends
of these membrane bound

117
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:43,006
antibodies are specific to
certain parts of certain

118
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:45,064
pathogens, to certain
epitopes.

119
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:49,002
Remember, epitopes were the
parts of certain pathogens

120
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:53,000
that these specific chains can
recognize and bond to.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,066
So let's say that we're
dealing with a

122
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,037
virus in this situation.

123
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,039
And let's say the virus
just happens to

124
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,011
bond to this B cell.

125
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,075
Remember, there might be
other-- in fact, there

126
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:08,091
definitely are tons of other
B cells around, but their

127
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:17,012
variable portions are
all different.

128
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,093
And that's what I always find
amazing about B cells is that

129
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:23,061
they come from the same genetic
line, their genes have

130
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:26,057
been shuffled around in their
development so that they can

131
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:29,082
produce billions of combinations
of these

132
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:34,037
proteins, or the variable ends
of their antibodies.

133
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:37,039
So let's say we have
some virus.

134
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,030
Let me say it's a bacteria.

135
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,085
When I did the other B cell
example, I said we're dealing

136
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:41,045
with viruses.

137
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:46,086
But let's say some new bacteria
and just some part of

138
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:50,055
its surface just happens to
bind to only this B cell--

139
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:52,074
because this B cell has just
the right combination.

140
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:57,000
So some part of his surface
binds just to that B cell

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,060
right there.

142
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,075
That part of the surface that
binds, remember, that was

143
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,000
called the epitope.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,092
That's that part of the pathogen
that binds to our

145
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,077
variable sequencer.

146
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:09,002
It won't bind to this B cell
or this B cell because they

147
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:12,054
have different sequences here,
but it binds to this B cell

148
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:15,018
and then that starts the
activation process.

149
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,082
We'll go into-- sometimes this
by itself can get the B cell

150
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:22,066
activated, but you normally
need help from helper T

151
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,082
cells-- and we'll talk
more about that.

152
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:27,012
And we said, once this
happens, once you get

153
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:30,062
activated or the activation
process starts, this guy

154
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:32,085
actually gets engulfed-- and I
didn't talk about that in the

155
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,074
last video just because I didn't
want to go into too

156
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,039
much detail.

157
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,023
So this whole thing gets
engulfed by the B cell.

158
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:46,087
And then when it gets activated,
it proliferates

159
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,095
itself and you normally need
the T cells there and some

160
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:52,024
part of them become plasma B
cells, some part of them

161
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:53,049
become memory B cells.

162
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:58,058


163
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:02,035
Remember, the plasma B cells
say, gee, I've been activated.

164
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:05,018
I'm just going to produce a
ton of these antibodies.

165
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,085
So the plasma B cell will just
produce tons of these

166
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,072
antibodies and start spitting
them out so that they can

167
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:14,001
attach to more and more of that
pathogen and just mess

168
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:18,064
them up in different ways,
either tag them so that other

169
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:23,006
macrophages or phagocytes eat
them up-- or tag two of them

170
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,037
so you bundle them up so that
they can't operate properly.

171
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,069
Whatever.

172
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,012
I'm not going to go into
detail on that.

173
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,038
That's when it gets activated.

174
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,086
But the interesting thing is
that the B cell will also do

175
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,090
what the phagocytes do.

176
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:41,084
The B cell will also take
this guy into the cell.

177
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:47,010
Maybe he's initially attached
to the antibody-- and break

178
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:55,013
him up, take pieces of this
pathogen and attach it to MHC

179
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:59,078
II proteins and then present
them on the surface.

180
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:03,049
So a B cell will also
present the antigen.

181
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,097


182
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:11,022
So this is also an MHC
II complex-- a major

183
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:13,078
histocompatibility complex--
and just so you know, histo

184
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:14,070
means tissue.

185
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,004
So this is related to whether
something is compatible with

186
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,025
the tissue in your body and
we'll talk more about that and

187
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,037
how it relates to transplants
and all of that.

188
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:25,075
So this is also an
MHC class II.

189
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:28,025
In both cases, whether we're
talking about B cells that

190
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,095
recognize a very specific
pathogen-- and it could be a

191
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:37,009
specific virus, a specific
protein, a specific bacteria,

192
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,035
or in the cases of phagocytes,
they'll just say,

193
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:41,021
oh, you look shady.

194
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,004
Let me take you in.

195
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,029
I don't know what type of
bacteria or virus or protein

196
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,094
you are, but in either case,
they both engulf them, take

197
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:50,019
pieces of them, cut them up,
and present them on their

198
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,058
surface in a complex
with the major

199
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:57,003
histocompatibility complexes.

200
00:09:57,003 --> 00:10:01,045
So cells that do this are called
professional antigen

201
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:02,070
presenting cells.

202
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,008


203
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,076
This is what they do for a
living, although they do other

204
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:09,042
things, as we've seen.

205
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,075
The phagocytes eat things.

206
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:14,063
The B cells generate antibodies
or memories so that

207
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:17,035
they can later be activated to
generate antibodies, but these

208
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:25,073
are called professional antigen
presenting cell.

209
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:29,062
And the antigen in question is
this little piece of the

210
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:35,041
actual thing that you're trying
to track, that little

211
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,072
piece-- the actual part of the
pathogen, that's what the

212
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,051
antigen-- so it's presenting
the antigen.

213
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:48,062
It's professional because it
takes pathogens from in the

214
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:51,094
fluid of our system and then
engulfs them, breaks them up,

215
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,050
and then presents them.

216
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,080
Now there are also
nonprofessional antigen

217
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,052
presenting cells.

218
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,090
And in fact, most
cells are this.

219
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,060
In fact, even these guys.

220
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,076
Actually, I'm going to wait
for the next video.

221
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,096
I realize all of my videos
are getting long.

222
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:10,027
So you're probably thinking,
these guys in either case

223
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:12,002
engulf them, cut them
up, present them,

224
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,032
what is it good for?

225
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:18,069
You'll see these MHC II, these
are what are recognized by

226
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,028
helper T cells.

227
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:23,083
It'll all form part of the
puzzle of how our immune

228
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,041
system works.

229
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,015
So in the next video, I'll talk
about MHC I presenting

230
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:31,045
cells, which is pretty
much all body cells.

231
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:32,009

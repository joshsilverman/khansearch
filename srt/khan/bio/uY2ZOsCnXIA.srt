1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,016
I think we have a respectable
sense of how muscles contract

3
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:04,051
on the molecular level.

4
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:08,008
Let's take a step back now and
just understand how muscles

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,072
look, at least structurally, or
how they relate to things

6
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:12,037
that we normally associate
with muscles.

7
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:16,014
So let me draw a flexing
bicep right here.

8
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,089


9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,094
That's their elbow and
let's say that's

10
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:23,053
their hand right there.

11
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:25,043
So this is their bicep
and it's flexing.

12
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:28,012


13
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:30,089
I think we've all seen diagrams
of what muscles look,

14
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,082
at least on kind of a macro
level and it's connected to

15
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:36,000
the bones at either end.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,009
Let me draw the bones.

17
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,006
I'm not going to detail where--
so it's connected to

18
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,006
the bones at either
end by tendons.

19
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:49,060
So this right here would
be some bone.

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,090
Right there would be another
bone that it's connected to.

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,032
And then this is tendons, which
connects the bones to

22
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,057
the muscles.

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:02,061


24
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,056
We have the general sense--
connected to two bones, when

25
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:07,031
it contracts it moves some part
of our skeletal system.

26
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,002
So we're actually focused
on skeletal muscles.

27
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,078


28
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:15,065
The other types are smooth
muscles and cardiac muscles.

29
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:19,028
Cardiac muscles are those, as
you can imagine, in our heart.

30
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:23,000
And smooth muscles are-- these
are more involuntary, slow

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,060
moving muscles and things like
our digestive tract.

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,073
And I'll do video on that in
the future, but most of the

33
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:30,032
time when people say muscles,
we associate them with

34
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:33,054
skeletal muscles that move our
skeletal system around, allow

35
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:38,071
us to run and lift and talk
and do and bite things.

36
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,093
So this is what we normally
associate-- let's dig in a

37
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:41,095
little bit deeper here.

38
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:45,067
So if I were to take a cross
section of this bicep right

39
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:50,012
there-- if I were to take a
cross section of that muscle

40
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:52,028
right there-- so let
me do it big.

41
00:01:52,028 --> 00:02:06,076


42
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:11,040
And then it looks something
like this.

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,002
This is the inside of this
muscle over here.

44
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,096
Now I said back here,
we had our tendon.

45
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:22,040


46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,087
And then there's actually a
covering; there's no strict

47
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:29,009
demarcation or dividing line
between the tendon and the

48
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:35,009
covering around this muscle,
but that covering is called

49
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:42,006
the epimysium and it's really
just connective tissue that

50
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:45,044
covers the muscle, kind of
protects it, reduces friction

51
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:49,012
between the muscle and the
surrounding bone and other

52
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:52,062
tissue that might be in this
person's arm right there.

53
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:56,096
And then within this muscle, you
have connective tissue on

54
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,097
the inside.

55
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:59,056
Let me do it in another color.

56
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,081
I'll do it in orange.

57
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:17,059


58
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:21,046
This is called a perimyseum,
and that's also just

59
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,086
connective tissue inside
of the actual muscle.

60
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:28,097


61
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:32,078
And then each of these things
that the perimysium is

62
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:37,069
dividing off-- let me say if we
were to take one of these

63
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,040
things and allow it to go a
little bit further-- so if we

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,087
were to take this thing right
here-- what this perimysium is

65
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,080
dividing off-- and if we were to
pull it out-- actually, let

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,025
me do this one right here.

67
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:51,059
If we were to pull this one out
just like that-- so you

68
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:55,005
have the perimysium surrounding
it, right?

69
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,084
This is all perimysium, and
it's just a fancy word for

70
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,062
connective tissue.

71
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:01,059
There's other stuff in there.

72
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,093
You could have nerves and you
could have capillaries, all

73
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:07,091
sorts of stuff because you have
to get blood and neuronal

74
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,015
signals to your muscles of
entry so it's not just

75
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:10,068
connective tissue.

76
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:13,080
It's other things that have to
be able to eventually get to

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,094
your muscle cells.

78
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:19,031
So each of these-- I guess you'd
call it subfibers, but

79
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:23,022
these are pretty big subfibers
of the muscle.

80
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,047
This is called a fascicle.

81
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:35,064


82
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:39,060
The connective tissue inside of
the fascicle is called the

83
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,085
endomysium.

84
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:45,031


85
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:48,068
So once again, more connective
tissues, has capillaries in

86
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:52,064
it, has nerves in it, all of
the things that have to

87
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:57,037
eventually come in contact
with muscle cells.

88
00:04:57,037 --> 00:05:00,001
We're inside of a
single muscle.

89
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:04,085


90
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,031
All this green connective
tissue is endomysium.

91
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:12,074


92
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:16,022
And each of these things that
are in the endomysium are an

93
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:18,024
actual muscle cell.

94
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:20,014
This is an actual muscle cell.

95
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,031
I'll do it in purple.

96
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,069
So this thing right here-- I can
pull it out a little bit.

97
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:30,037


98
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:37,011
If I pull this out, this is
an actual muscle cell.

99
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,099
This is what we wanted to get
to, but we're going to go even

100
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:43,061
within the muscle cell to see,
understand how all the myosin

101
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,092
and the actin filaments fit
into that muscle cell.

102
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:48,059
So this right here is a muscle
cell or a myofiber.

103
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,043


104
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,097
The two prefixes you'll see
a lot when dealing with

105
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:58,000
muscles-- you're going to see
myo, which you can imagine

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,070
refers to muscle.

107
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,099
And you're also going to see
the word sarco, like

108
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,093
sarcolemma, or sarcoplasmic
reticulum.

109
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:09,097
So you're also go see the
prefix sarco and that's

110
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:13,098
flesh-- so sarcophagus-- or you
can think of other things

111
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,089
that start with sarco.

112
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,085
So sarco is flesh.

113
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,075
Muscle is flesh and
myo is muscle.

114
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:20,022
So this is myofiber.

115
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,064
This is an actual muscle cell
and so let's zoom in on the

116
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,031
actual muscle.

117
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:27,049
So let me actually draw it
really a lot bigger here.

118
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:30,056
So an actual muscle cell
is called a myofiber.

119
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,075
It's called a fiber because it's
longer than it is wide

120
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:37,037
and they come in various--
let me draw the

121
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,087
myofiber like this.

122
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:45,060


123
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,019
I'll take a cross section of
the muscle cell as well.

124
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:52,062


125
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:57,011
And these can be relatively
short-- several hundred

126
00:06:57,011 --> 00:07:00,051
micrometers-- or it could be
quite long-- at least quite

127
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:02,050
long by cellular standards.

128
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,033
We're talking several
centimeters.

129
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,016
Think of it as a cell.

130
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,032
That's quite a long cell.

131
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,075
Because it's so long,
it actually has to

132
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,076
have multiple nucleuses.

133
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:15,027
Actually, to draw the nucleuses,
let me do a better

134
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,047
job drawing the myofiber.

135
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:21,050
I'm going to make little lumps
in the outside membranes where

136
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,074
the nucleuses can fit
on this myofiber.

137
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:29,032
Remember, this is just one of
these individual muscle cells

138
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,075
and they're really long so they
have multiple nucleuses.

139
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,060
Let me take its cross section
because we're going to go

140
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,080
inside of this muscle cell.

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,020
So I said it's multinucleated.

142
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,033
So if we kind of imagine its
membrane being transparent,

143
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:46,093
there'd be one nucleus over
here, another nucleus over

144
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:49,019
here, another nucleus
over here, another

145
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,017
nucleus over there.

146
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,062
And the reason why it's
multinucleated is so that over

147
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:55,082
large distances, you don't have
to wait for proteins to

148
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,098
get all the way from this
nucleus all the way over to

149
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:59,008
this part of the muscle cell.

150
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:03,001
You can actually have the DNA
information close to where it

151
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:03,068
needs to be.

152
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,085
So it's multinucleated.

153
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:08,073
I read one-- I think it was 30
or so nucleuses per millimeter

154
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,069
of muscle tissue is what
the average is.

155
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,068
I don't know if that's actually
the case, but the

156
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:17,037
nucleuses are kind of right
under the membrane of the

157
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,061
muscle cell-- and you remember
what that's called from the

158
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,000
last video.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,004
The membrane of the muscle
cell is the sarcolemma.

160
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:31,037


161
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,062
These are the nucleuses.

162
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:36,076


163
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:43,069
And then if you take the cross
section of that, there are

164
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:47,007
tubes within that called
myofibrils.

165
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:53,029
So here there's a bunch
of tubes inside

166
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,021
of the actual cell.

167
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:56,037
Let me pull one of them out.

168
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,004
So I've pulled out one
of these tubes.

169
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,029
This is a myofibril.

170
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:04,038


171
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:07,036
And if you were to look at this
under a light microscope,

172
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:11,037
you'll see it has little
striations on it.

173
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:14,019
the striations will look
something like that, like

174
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:17,055
that, like that, and there'll
be little thin ones

175
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,011
like that, like that.

176
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:24,020
And inside of these myofibrils
is where we'll find our myosin

177
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,025
and actin filaments.

178
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:28,016
So let's zoom in over here
on this myofibril.

179
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:31,090
We'll just keep zooming until we
get to the molecular level.

180
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:36,029
So this myofibril, which is--
remember, it's inside of the

181
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,022
muscle cell, inside
of the myofiber.

182
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,009
The myofiber is a muscle cell.

183
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,063
Myofibral is a-- you can view
it as a tube inside of the

184
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,058
muscle cell.

185
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,038
These are the things that
are actually doing the

186
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,060
contraction.

187
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,026
So if I were to zoom in on a
myofibril, you're going to see

188
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:56,083
it-- it's going to look
something like that and it's

189
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,001
going to have those
bands in it.

190
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,003
So the bands are going to look
something like this.

191
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:05,044
You're going to have these
short bands like that.

192
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:09,071


193
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:14,016
Then you're going to have wider
bands like that, like

194
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:18,001
these little dark-- trying my
best to draw them relatively

195
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,040
neatly and there could be a
little line right there.

196
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,066
Then the same thing
repeats over here.

197
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,010
So each of these units of

198
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,002
repetition is called a sarcomere.

199
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:37,004


200
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,054
And these units of repetition go
from one-- this is called a

201
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:43,049
Z-line to another Z-line.

202
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,005
And all of this terminology
comes out of when people just

203
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,042
looked under a microscope and
they saw these lines, they

204
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,007
started attaching names to it.

205
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:52,045
And just so you have the other
terminology-- we'll talk about

206
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:55,005
how this relates to the myosin
and the actin in a second.

207
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,033
This right here is the A-band.

208
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:00,072


209
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:03,040
And then this distance right
here or these parts right

210
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,085
here, these are called
the I-bands.

211
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:09,037
And we'll talk about really in a
few seconds how that relates

212
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:12,061
to the mechanisms or the units
that we talked-- or the

213
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,029
molecules that we talked about
in the last video.

214
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,071
So if you were to zoom in here,
if you were to go into

215
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:20,044
these myofibrils, if you were
to take a cross section of

216
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:24,005
these myofibrils, what you'll
find is-- if you were to cut

217
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:28,096
it up, maybe slice it-- if you
were slice it parallel to the

218
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:32,019
actual screen that you're
looking at, you're going to

219
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,065
see something like this.

220
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:35,038
So this is going to
be your Z-band.

221
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:41,011


222
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,053
This is your next Z-band.

223
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:45,015
So I'm zooming in on
sarcomere now.

224
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:49,055
This is another Z-band.

225
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:53,028
Then you have your
actin filaments.

226
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,091
Now we're getting to that
molecular level

227
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,016
that I talked about.

228
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:17,000


229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,025
And then in between the actin
filaments, you have your

230
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:22,090
myosin filaments.

231
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:27,070


232
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,053
Remember, the myosin filaments
had those two heads on them.

233
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:36,066
They each have two heads like
that, that crawl along the

234
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,038
actin filaments.

235
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:39,025
I'm just drawing a couple of
them and then they're attached

236
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,080
at the middle just like that.

237
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,067
We'll talk about in a second
what happens when the muscle

238
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,064
actually contracts.

239
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:48,007
And I could draw it
again over here.

240
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,005


241
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,044
So it has many more heads than
what I'm drawing, but this

242
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,007
just gives you an idea
of what's happening.

243
00:12:55,007 --> 00:13:00,000


244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,032
These are the myosin, I guess,
proteins and they all

245
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,065
intertwined like we saw in the
previous video and then

246
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:08,046
there'll be another
one over here.

247
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,095
I don't have to draw
in detail.

248
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:12,088
So you can see immediately that
the A-band corresponds to

249
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:15,003
where we have our myosin.

250
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,025
So this is our A-band
right here.

251
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:20,010


252
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,067
And there is an overlap.

253
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:27,077
They do overlap each other, even
in the resting state, but

254
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:30,007
the I-band is where you
only have actin

255
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,074
filaments, no myosin.

256
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:36,007


257
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:39,040
And then the myosin filaments
are held in place by titin,

258
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,046
which you can kind of imagine
as a springy protein.

259
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:46,018
I want to do it in a different
color than that.

260
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:52,001


261
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,051
So the myosin is held
in place by titin.

262
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:58,030


263
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,078
It's attached to the
Z-band by titin.

264
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:01,075
So what happened?

265
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:07,034
So we have all of these-- when
a neuron excites-- so let me

266
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:10,060
draw an endpoint of a neuron
right here, the endpoint of an

267
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,047
axon of a neuron right there.

268
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,027
It's a motor neuron.

269
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,096
It's telling this
guy to contract.

270
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,066
You have the action potential.

271
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:21,046
The action potential travels
along the membrane, really in

272
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,058
all directions.

273
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:24,086
And then it eventually, if we
look at it from this view,

274
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:29,069
they have those little
transverse or T-tubules.

275
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:35,086
They essentially go into the
cell and continue to propagate

276
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,013
the action potential.

277
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:41,098
Those trigger the sarcoplasmic
reticulum to release calcium.

278
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:46,058
The calcium attaches to the
troponin that's attached to

279
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:50,034
these actin filaments that moves
the tropomyosin out of

280
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:52,028
the way, and then the
crawling can occur.

281
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:55,012
The myosin can start
using ATP to crawl

282
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:57,005
along these actin filaments.

283
00:14:57,005 --> 00:15:03,021
And so as you can imagine, as
they crawl along, their power

284
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:07,004
stroke is going to push-- you
can either view it as the

285
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,012
actin filaments in that way or
you can say that the myosin is

286
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,049
going to want to move in that
direction, but you're pulling

287
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,044
on both sides of
a rope, right?

288
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:18,003
So the myosin is going to stay
in one place and the actin

289
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,071
filaments are going to
be pulled together.

290
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,061


291
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:25,074
And that's essentially how the
muscle is contracting.

292
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:28,083
So we've, hopefully, in this
video, connected the big

293
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,023
picture from the flexing muscle
all the way over here

294
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,091
to exactly what's happening at
the molecular level that we

295
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,000
learned in the last
few videos.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,050
And you can imagine, when this
happens to all of the

297
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,085
myofibrils inside of the muscle,
right, because the

298
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:45,054
sarcoplasmic reticulum's
releasing calcium generally

299
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:49,069
into the cytoplasm of-- which
is also called myoplasm,

300
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,011
because we're dealing with
muscle cells-- the cytoplasm

301
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,037
of this muscle cell.

302
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,021
The calcium floods all
of these myofibrils.

303
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:00,090
It's able to attach to all of
the troponin-- or at least a

304
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:05,030
lot of the troponin on top of
these actin filaments and then

305
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,000
the whole muscle contracts.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,034
And then when that's done, each
muscle fiber, myofiber,

307
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,002
or each muscle cell
will not have that

308
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:14,035
much contracting power.

309
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,092
But when you couple it with all
of them that are around

310
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:19,003
it-- if you just have one,
actually, working, or a few of

311
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,024
them, you'll just
have a twitch.

312
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:22,071
But if you have all of them
contracting together, then

313
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:25,026
that's actually going to create
the force to actually

314
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,041
do some work, or actually pull
your bones together, or lift

315
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,091
some weights.

316
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,098
So hopefully you found
that mildly useful.

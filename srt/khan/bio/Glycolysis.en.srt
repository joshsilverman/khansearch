1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,049


2
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,022
We've already learned that
cellular respiration can be

3
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,082
broken down into roughly
three phases.

4
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:11,049


5
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:16,076
The first is glycolysis, which
literally means the breaking

6
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:18,001
down of glucose.

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:23,062


8
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:27,053
And then this can occur with
or without oxygen.

9
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:31,058
If we don't have oxygen, then
we go over to fermentation.

10
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:34,079
We'll talk about that
in the future.

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,032
Go over to fermentation
and in humans it

12
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,075
produces lactic acid.

13
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:41,014
In other types of organisms
it might

14
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:43,020
produce alcohol or ethanol.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,067
But if we have oxygen-- and for
the most part we're going

16
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:48,068
to assume that we can proceed
forward with oxygen-- if there

17
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:50,060
is oxygen, then we could
proceed forward

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,018
to the Krebs cycle.

19
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:58,075
Sometimes called the citric acid
cycle because it deals

20
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,039
with citric acid.

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,039
The same thing that's in
orange juice or lemons.

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,062
And then from there
we proceed to the

23
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:07,031
electron transport chain.

24
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:10,009


25
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,075
And we learned in the first
overview video of cellular

26
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:15,060
respiration that this is where
the bulk of the ATP is

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,050
actually produced.

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,092
Although it uses raw materials
that came out of

29
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:20,035
these phases up here.

30
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:23,045
Now what I want to do in this
video is just focus on

31
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,070
glycolysis.

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,050


33
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,007
And this is kind of-- it's
sometimes a challenging task

34
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,082
because you can really get
stuck in the weeds.

35
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,054
And I'll show you the weeds
in a little bit,

36
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,048
and the actual mechanism.

37
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:36,075
And it can be very daunting.

38
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:39,015
But what I want to do is
simplify it for you so you can

39
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,042
have the big take-aways.

40
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,054
And then we can appreciate, and
then maybe when we look at

41
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:45,076
the weeds of glycolysis we
can make a little bit

42
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,093
more sense of it.

43
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:49,023
So glycolysis, or really
cellular respiration, it

44
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:50,048
starts off with glucose.

45
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:53,023


46
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,012
And glucose, we know
its formula.

47
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:59,065
It's C6H12O6.

48
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,084
And I could draw its whole
structure; it would take a

49
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:02,029
little time.

50
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,026
But I'm just going to focus
on the carbon backbone.

51
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:07,001
So it is a ring, or
can be a ring.

52
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:12,069
But I'm just going to draw it
as six carbons in a row.

53
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,094
Now there's two kind of
important phases of glycolysis

54
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,081
that are good to know.

55
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:19,041
One, I call the investment
phase.

56
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:23,000
And the investment phase
actually uses two ATPs.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,090


58
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,027
So you know, the whole purpose
of cellular respiration is to

59
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,065
generate ATPs, but right from
the get-go I actually have to

60
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:37,036
use two ATPs.

61
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:40,097
But I use two ATPs and then I'm
essentially going to break

62
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:50,071
up the glucose into two 3-carbon
compounds right here

63
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,072
that actually also have a
phosphate group on them.

64
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,068
The phosphate groups are
coming from those ATPs.

65
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,090
They also have a phosphate
group on them and this is

66
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,052
often called-- well, there's
a lot of names for it.

67
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,090
Sometimes it's called PGAL.

68
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,003
You really don't have
to know this.

69
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:12,036
Or phosphoglyceraldehyde, really
challenging my spelling

70
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,041
skills right here.

71
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,041
That's not that important
to know.

72
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,094
All you have to know
is in this first

73
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,084
phase you use two ATPs.

74
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:20,034
That's why I call it the
investment phase.

75
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:29,002
If we use a business analogy,
investment phase.

76
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:33,050
And then each of these two PGAL
molecules can then go

77
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,034
into the payoff phase.

78
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:39,047
So in the payoff phase,
each of these

79
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:42,028
PGALs turn into pyruvate.

80
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,031
Which is another 3-carbon,
but it's reconfigured.

81
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:48,066
But the process of it going to
pyruvate-- and let me write

82
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:53,012
pyruvate in blue, because this
is something that, at least

83
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,062
it's good to know the word.

84
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:56,028
And I'll show you the structure
in a second.

85
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,009
Pyruvate.

86
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,072
Sometimes it's called
pyruvic acid.

87
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,056
Same thing.

88
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:05,088
And that's essentially the end
product of glycolysis.

89
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:08,019
So you start off with glucose
in the investment phase.

90
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,047
You end up in this
phosphoglyceraldehyde, which

91
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:12,053
essentially you broke up your
glucose and you put a

92
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,006
phosphate on either end of it.

93
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:17,031
And then those each
independently go through the

94
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,049
payoff phase.

95
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,002
So you end up with two molecules
of pyruvate for

96
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:25,022
every molecule of glucose
you started off with.

97
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,086
Now you're saying, hey, Sal,
there was a payoff phase, what

98
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:30,031
was our payoff?

99
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:35,070
Well our payoff, we got, for
each-- let me write this down

100
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,027
as a payoff phase.

101
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,052
This is our payoff phase.

102
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:41,045


103
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:43,014
And I apologize for the
white background.

104
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:45,030
I did it because, the mechanism
I'm showing you, I

105
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,080
copy-and-pasted it from
Wikipedia, and they had a

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,038
white background so I just ran
with the white background for

107
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:50,094
this video.

108
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:53,091
But I, personally at least, like
the black background a

109
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:55,004
lot better.

110
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,075
But this is the payoff
phase right here.

111
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,099
And so when we go from the
phosphoglyceraldehyde to the

112
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:05,007
pyruvate or the pyruvic acid,
we produce two things.

113
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,042
Or I guess we could say we
produce three things.

114
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:11,086
We produce, each of
these PGALs to

115
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,044
pyruvates produce two ATPs.

116
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:16,012


117
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,087
So I'm going to produce two
ATPs there, I'm going to

118
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:20,049
produce two ATPs there.

119
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:22,041
And then they each
produce an NADH.

120
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:27,054


121
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:29,081
And I'll do it in
a darker color.

122
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:31,006
NADH.

123
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:36,093


124
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:39,091
And of course they're not
producing the whole molecule

125
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,080
in a vacuum.

126
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,044
Essentially what they're doing
is they're starting with the

127
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:47,063
raw material of an NAD plus-- so
they start off with an NAD

128
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:51,025
plus-- and they essentially
reduce

129
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,014
it by adding a hydrogen.

130
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:55,017
Remember, we learned a couple
of videos ago that you could

131
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:57,082
view reduction as a
gain in hydrogen.

132
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:01,011
So the NAD gets reduced
to NADH.

133
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,011
And then later on, these NADHs
are used in electron transport

134
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:08,047
chain to actually
produce ATPs.

135
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:13,008
So the big take-away here, if
I were to write the reaction

136
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:16,038
that we get for glycolysis,
is that you

137
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:17,063
start off with a glucose.

138
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:21,048


139
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,051
And you need some NAD plus.

140
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,083


141
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,087
And actually, for every mole
of glucose, you're going to

142
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:33,054
need two NAD plusses.

143
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:34,099
You're going to need two ATPs.

144
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,042


145
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,086
So I'm just writing all the
ingredients that we need to

146
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:42,035
start off with.

147
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,075
And then you're going to need--
well, let me say, these

148
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:47,029
guys are going to be ADPs before
we turn them to ATPs.

149
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,055
So I'll write plus four ADPs.

150
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:57,014
And then, after performing
glycolysis-- and

151
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:57,083
let me write it here.

152
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,005
Let me write also-- sorry
that was ADPs.

153
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,094


154
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:08,097
Let me just rewrite that
part right there.

155
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,054
Four ADPs.

156
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,038
And then you maybe need
two phosphate groups.

157
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:15,081
Because we're going to need
four phosphate groups.

158
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,054
Plus four-- I'll just call
them, sometimes they're

159
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,031
written like that.

160
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,043
But maybe I'll write
it like this.

161
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,074
Four phosphate groups.

162
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:25,067


163
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:30,079
And then once you perform
glycolysis, you have two

164
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:37,068
pyruvates, you have two NADHs.

165
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:40,066


166
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,018
The NAD has been reduced.

167
00:07:43,018 --> 00:07:45,000
It gained a hydrogen.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,085
RIG.

169
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:46,058
OIL RIG.

170
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,085
Reduction is gain an electron.

171
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,019
But in the biological
sense, we think of

172
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,011
it gaining the hydrogen.

173
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,031
Because hydrogen is very
non-electronegative, so you're

174
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,025
hogging its electrons.

175
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,001
You've gained its electrons.

176
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:01,081
So two NADHs and then plus these
two ATPs get used in the

177
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,072
investment phase.

178
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,038
That's why I kind of wrote
them a little separately.

179
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:05,086
So these two get used.

180
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,086
So then you're left
with two ADPs.

181
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,086


182
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:13,062
And then these guys,
essentially,

183
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,075
get turned into ATPs.

184
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:19,008
So plus four ATPs.

185
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,056
I guess we didn't need four.

186
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,088
We only needed a net of
two phosphate groups.

187
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,056
Because two jump off of here.

188
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,070
And then we need a total
of two more to get

189
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,056
four jumping on there.

190
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:31,026
But the big picture is, you
start with a glucose, you end

191
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:33,001
up with two pyruvates.

192
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,009
You use up two ATPs.

193
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,090
You get four ATPs.

194
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,055
So you have a net of
two ATPs formed.

195
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:41,049
Let me write that very big.

196
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,084
Net, what you get out of
glycolysis, is two ATPs.

197
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:51,028
You get two NADHs that can
each later be used in the

198
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,060
electron transport chain
to produce three ATPs.

199
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,014
You get two NADHs and you get
two pyruvates, which are going

200
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:02,092
to be re-engineered into
acetyl-CoAs that are going to

201
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:04,095
be the raw materials for
the Krebs cycle.

202
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:10,069
But these are the outputs
of glycolysis.

203
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,007
So now that we have that big
picture, let's actually look

204
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:13,079
at the mechanism.

205
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,073
Because this is a little
bit more daunting

206
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:16,044
when you see it here.

207
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:18,097
But we'll see the same themes
that I just talked about.

208
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:22,000
We're starting with a
glucose right there.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,026
It is a six chain.

210
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:26,005
It's in a circle, in a ring.

211
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:30,027
One, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

212
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,011
I could write it like that,
just to make a huge

213
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,022
oversimplification.

214
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:36,001
It goes through a few steps.

215
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,046
I use an ATP here.

216
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,042
So let me do that in a color.

217
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:42,030
Let me do it in orange whenever
I use an ATP.

218
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,087
I use one ATP there.

219
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:46,004
I use one ATP there.

220
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,050
And just like I told you,
they have a slightly

221
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,037
different name for it.

222
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:49,087
But this is the

223
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:52,003
phosphoglyceraldehyde right here.

224
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,048
They call it glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

225
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,085
It's the exact same molecule.

226
00:09:56,085 --> 00:10:00,012
But as you can see, just when I
drew it very roughly before,

227
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:03,001
you've got one, two three
carbons there.

228
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,066


229
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,062
And it also has a phosphate
group on it.

230
00:10:07,062 --> 00:10:09,060
The phosphate group's actually
attached to the oxygen.

231
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,015
But for just for simplification
I draw the

232
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,055
phosphate group just
like that.

233
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,075
And I showed that right here.

234
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,044
This was the

235
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,053
phosphoglyceraldehyde right here.

236
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,070
This is the actual structure
up here.

237
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,062
But I think sometimes when you
look at the structure it's

238
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,067
easy to miss the big picture.

239
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,048
And there are two of these.

240
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:28,060
They kind of say that you can
go back and forth with this,

241
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,019
with this other kind
of isomer of this.

242
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,074
But the important thing is that
you have two of these

243
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:34,095
compounds that are now
3-carbon compounds.

244
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:36,051
Glucose has been split.

245
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:39,064
And now we're ready to enter
the payoff phase.

246
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:43,004
Remember you have two of these
compounds right here.

247
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,061
That's why, when they drew this
mechanism, they wrote

248
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,030
times two right there.

249
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,064
Because the glucose has
been split into

250
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,009
two of these molecules.

251
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,080
So each of the molecules
are now going to

252
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,000
do this right here.

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,042
And for each of the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates,

254
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:58,060
or PGALs, or
phosphoglyceraldehyde, we can

255
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,091
look at the mechanism and say,
OK look here, there's going to

256
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:06,026
be an ADP turning into
an ATP there.

257
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:09,009
So this is plus one ATP.

258
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,040
And then we see it again
happening here

259
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,071
on our way to pyruvate.

260
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:17,010
On our way to pyruvate right,
there then we have another

261
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,033
plus one ATP.

262
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:23,063
So for each of the PGALs, or
the phosphoglyceraldehydes

263
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:29,028
that were produced, we're
producing two ATPs in the

264
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,020
payoff phase.

265
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,040
Now there were two of these.

266
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,003
So total for one glucose, we're
going to produce four

267
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:37,034
ATPs in the payoff phase.

268
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:39,041
So in the payoff phase,
four ATPs.

269
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:43,023
In the investment phase
we used one, two ATPs.

270
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:46,008
So total net ATPs directly
generated from

271
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:49,007
glycolysis is two ATPs.

272
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,044
Four, gross produced.

273
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,010
But we had to invest two in
the investment phase.

274
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,009
And then the NADs and the NADHs,
we see right here.

275
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,075
For each phosphoglyceraldehyde,
or

276
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:03,070
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates or
PGALs or whatever you want to

277
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,053
call them, at this stage right
here you see that we are

278
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:11,079
reducing NAD plus to NADH.

279
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,093
So this happens once for each
of these compounds.

280
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,050
And obviously there
are two of these.

281
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,033
Glucose got split into
two of these guys.

282
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:22,089
So two NADHs are going
to be produced.

283
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,008
And later these are going to
be used in the electron

284
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:30,089
transport chain to actually
each produce three ATPs.

285
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:32,087
And then finally, when
everything is said and done,

286
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,025
we're left with the pyruvates.

287
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,071
And it's nice, at least that
they made it nice and big.

288
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,054
We can take a look at what
a pyruvate looks like.

289
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,060
And just as promised, we can
look at all the oxygen bonds

290
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,013
and all that.

291
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,063
But it's a 3-carbon structure.

292
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,077
It has a 3-carbon backbone.

293
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:51,034
So the end result is that the
carbon, that the glucose got

294
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,027
split in half.

295
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:53,022
It got oxidized.

296
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,096
Some of the hydrogens got
stripped off of it.

297
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:57,019
As you can see there's only
three hydrogens here.

298
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,080
We started off with 12
hydrogens in glucose.

299
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,075
And now it has its carbons
bonding more

300
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,083
strongly with oxygen.

301
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,011
So it's essentially having its
electrons stolen by the

302
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,015
oxygens, or hogged
by the oxygens.

303
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:11,042
So carbon has gotten oxidized
in this process.

304
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:14,012
There's going to be more
oxidation left to do.

305
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:20,047
And in the process we were able
to generate two net ATPs

306
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:26,092
and two NADHs that can later
be used to produce ATPs.

307
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:29,057
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.

308
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:29,060

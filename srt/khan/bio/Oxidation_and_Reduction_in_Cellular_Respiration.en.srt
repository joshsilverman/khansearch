1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,059


2
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:03,039
Now that we have a little bit
of a review of oxidation and

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,083
reduction under our belts, let's
see if we can apply what

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:10,033
we now, maybe, re-understand
to cellular respiration.

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:14,065
So cellular respiration, for
every mole of a glucose,

6
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:19,096
C6H12O6, we combine that--
and maybe that's

7
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:21,003
in an aqueous state.

8
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,055
It's dissolved in water.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:28,010
We combine that with six moles
of molecular oxygen.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,098
And then our cells perform
cellular respiration in a

11
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,014
whole series of steps.

12
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:34,054
And I'll do more
videos on that.

13
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:39,046


14
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,078
I'll just abbreviate it.

15
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:47,052
And then we end up with six
moles of carbon dioxide.

16
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:50,071
We have to breathe this oxygen
in order to perform cellular

17
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,064
respiration and we have to
breathe this carbon dioxide

18
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,071
out because it's just a
byproduct of cellular

19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:56,063
respiration.

20
00:00:56,063 --> 00:01:00,089
Six moles of carbon dioxide,
six moles of water.

21
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:05,045
And the whole point of cellular
respiration is, plus

22
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:09,040
some energy is generated
by this reaction.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,062
And our bodies store
this energy.

24
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:13,089
Well, some of it is just
turned into heat.

25
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:16,015
But the whole point of cellular
respiration is to

26
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:20,065
store it as 38 ATPs, which we've
learned already is the

27
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:23,015
energy currency of biological
systems.

28
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:26,007
And then our bodies, or
biological systems in general,

29
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:30,034
can use these ATPs to contract
muscles or generate nerve

30
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:33,050
impulses or grow cells or divide
cells or whatever else

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,029
that a biological system
has to do.

32
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,079
In the last video we learned a
little bit about oxidation and

33
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,006
reduction, so let's apply
those ideas here.

34
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:47,051
Now we saw in the last video
that a chemist would say-- let

35
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:49,081
me write it this way-- a
chemist would say that

36
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:55,051
oxidation means losing
electrons, or not being able

37
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,076
to hog them.

38
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:59,015


39
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,015
While a chemist will
tell you that

40
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:06,031
reduction is gaining electrons.

41
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:12,002


42
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,046
And if you have trouble
remembering, oxidation is

43
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:19,068
losing, that's kind of OIL,
that's the mnemonic.

44
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:21,024
Oxygen is losing electrons.

45
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:22,049
Reduction is gaining.

46
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,006
Or, RIG.

47
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,006
So OIL RIG.

48
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,075
This is what you learned
in chemistry class.

49
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:30,090
Now biologists or biochemists
will say, oh, well, you know I

50
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,021
like to define it a little
bit differently.

51
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:40,053
A biologist will say that
oxidation is losing hydrogen

52
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:52,065
atoms. And they'll say reduction
is gaining hydrogen

53
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:55,072
atoms. And we saw in the last
video that this definition is

54
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,093
actually hard when you're
applying it to hydrogen

55
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,015
because it's not like a hydrogen
atom can lose itself

56
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:01,066
or gain itself.

57
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,087
And the reason why we said
that these two ideas are

58
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:07,019
consistent is because if I'm
talking about a carbon and a

59
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,053
carbon is losing a hydrogen.

60
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,090
So let's say I have some
compound that looks like this.

61
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,053
Maybe it's connected to a
bunch of other things

62
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,053
someplace else.

63
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:19,080
And then later on the carbon--
let's say I have a carbon that

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,090
looks like that and I have an
oxygen that's maybe bound to

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,071
another oxygen.

66
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:27,002
I'm doing a very kind of
hand-wavy explanation here.

67
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:30,018
And maybe that oxygen is bonded
to something else.

68
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,072
This is what I start off with.

69
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:34,012
And on the other side of this
equation I end up with

70
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,090
something that looks
like this.

71
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,075
Where a carbon is bonded
to an oxygen.

72
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:42,059
And maybe that other oxygen is
bonded to this hydrogen.

73
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:47,088
The biologist will say, oh, this
carbon has been oxidized

74
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:50,059
because it lost its hydrogen.

75
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,059
The hydrogen went from here--
I'll do it in a different

76
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:56,012
color-- went from this carbon
to this oxygen.

77
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,087
And the biologist would
also say that this

78
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:00,053
oxygen has been reduced.

79
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:03,050
It's been reduced because
it gained hydrogens.

80
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,065
But the reality, or maybe the
chemists' definition, which I

81
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:10,081
like a little bit more is, over
here because carbon is

82
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:14,036
more electronegative, we
see carbon is much more

83
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,043
electronegative than hydrogen.

84
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:18,082
And oxygen is even more
electronegative than carbon.

85
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:21,006
When any of these guys bond with
hydrogen they're going to

86
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,086
hog the electron.

87
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,017
So here, carbon got to
hog the electron.

88
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:31,074
So here, carbon hogs
electrons.

89
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:36,019
While here, carbon gets its
electrons hogged by oxygen.

90
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,061
So here, oxygen hogs.

91
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:40,083


92
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,085
So by losing the hydrogen, the
carbon actually lost its

93
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,056
opportunity to hog electrons.

94
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:47,093
And since it ended up bonding
with an oxygen, it not only

95
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:50,061
can't hog hydrogen's electrons
but then it gets its electrons

96
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:53,086
hogged by an even more
electronegative atom.

97
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,092
So that's why these two
definitions are consistent.

98
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,014
Same thing with the oxygen.

99
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,069
Here it's bonding with another
oxygen, not hogging anything.

100
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,012
But when it gains the hydrogen
it's able to

101
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,001
hog hydrogen's electrons.

102
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,029
Because it's so much more
electronegative.

103
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,083
Or you could say that it's
gaining electrons.

104
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,086
So that's why these two
definitions are somewhat

105
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,037
consistent.

106
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,026
Although sometimes they fall
apart if we're not dealing

107
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:16,091
with hydrogen.

108
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:21,007
The chemistry definition applies
more consistently to

109
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:21,066
everything.

110
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:24,018
But sometimes the biologists'
definition is easier to kind

111
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:24,085
of glance at.

112
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:27,020
Or you'll actually see it
written in textbooks.

113
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,064
So let's go back to cellular
respiration and try to figure

114
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:32,088
out what's being oxidized
and reduced.

115
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:35,000
So if we look over here.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,016
Over here we have our glucose.

117
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:40,061
And actually I copied and
pasted from Wikipedia a

118
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:41,030
glucose molecule.

119
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,040
And actually there's
one error here.

120
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,006
And maybe I should edit
it on Wikipedia.

121
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:47,082
There should be another hydrogen
bonded to that carbon

122
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,072
right there.

123
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:51,012
But as you see, all of the
hydrogens, they're either

124
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:56,087
bonded to an oxygen or
a carbon over here.

125
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,043
On the left-hand side, they're
either bonded to

126
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,002
an oxygen or a carbon.

127
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:02,075
If we were to write its
oxidation state, in every case

128
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,057
it's bonded to something that's
more electronegative.

129
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:07,006
So it's going to be giving
up its electrons.

130
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:10,070
So it will have a plus
one oxidation state.

131
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,087
And oxygen, in every case,
is either bonded to

132
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,080
a carbon or a hydrogen.

133
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,087
And so, oxygen, if it's bonded
to a carbon or a hydrogen, is

134
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,051
going to hog an electron from
either one of those guys.

135
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:25,000
So in every situation in
glucose, oxygen has a two

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,093
minus or a minus two
oxidation state.

137
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:31,008
And carbon, since this whole
thing is neutral, one would

138
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,007
think that carbon would have
a neutral oxidation state.

139
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:37,002
And if you go through this, you
actually find that most of

140
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:39,013
these carbons do have neutral
oxidation states.

141
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,007
Let me circle a few.

142
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,070
So for example, this carbon
right here, it's hogging an

143
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,050
electron from this hydrogen.

144
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,020
But then it gets an electron
hogged by this oxygen.

145
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,075
And then of course it does
nothing with the carbon.

146
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,085
So that's neutral.

147
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:53,070
This is neutral for
the same reason.

148
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,081
This is neutral for
the same reason.

149
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:59,032
This one is also neutral
for the same reason.

150
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,012
It's bonded with two carbons.

151
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,093
It has an electron
hogged by oxygen.

152
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:05,036
But then it hogs an electron
from hydrogen.

153
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,042
So it's neutral.

154
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,037
So four of these carbons
are neutral.

155
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:14,010
This carbon right here has two
electrons hogged by oxygens.

156
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,091
And then it gets to take one
back from the hydrogen.

157
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:19,075
So it has a plus one
oxidation state.

158
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,041
This one is the opposite.

159
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,051
It has two hydrogens
that it hogs from.

160
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,093
Then it has to give one
away to the oxygen.

161
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,033
So this has a minus one.

162
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,087
So these two cancel out.

163
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:31,012
On average, you can say that the
carbons in glucose have a

164
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:32,091
neutral oxidation state.

165
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:34,057
And I'm dealing with the
chemist definition.

166
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,075
And I'm going to show you
that they're essentially

167
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,092
equivalent.

168
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:40,020
Here all of the oxygens have
no oxidation state.

169
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,093
Because they're just bonded.

170
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,042
Let me do it in a
better color.

171
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:47,050
No oxidation state or neutral
oxidation state because

172
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,068
they're double bonded
with oxygen.

173
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,085
No one's hogging from anyone.

174
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:52,080
They're obviously equally
electronegative.

175
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,001
If we look at the
products, carbon

176
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,033
dioxide looks like this.

177
00:07:56,033 --> 00:08:02,005
So, in either of these cases,
oxygen is hogging two

178
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,081
electrons from this carbon.

179
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,099
So it has a minus two
oxygen state.

180
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,044
This oxygen is hogging two
electrons from carbon.

181
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:10,060
So it has a minus two
oxidation state.

182
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,048
And this carbon is getting all
of its valence electrons, all

183
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,095
four, hogged by the oxygen.

184
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:18,006
So it has a plus four
oxidation state.

185
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:20,037
It's lost four electrons,
you can imagine.

186
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:21,057
Because it's getting hogged.

187
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:22,030
So that's carbon.

188
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,094
So we could write this as four
plus for the carbon.

189
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:27,016
And then each oxygen
has a two minus.

190
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,018
And we can do the math later
on to figure out

191
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,036
what the total is.

192
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,066
And then, if we look at the
water-- we've looked at this

193
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:36,023
before-- the oxygen is hogging
two electrons,

194
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:39,001
one from each hydrogen.

195
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:39,078
So two minus.

196
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:41,099
And then each of the hydrogens
have a plus

197
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,000
one oxidation state.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,079
So if you want to do a half
reaction for cellular

199
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:50,071
respiration, and in the
chemists' sense of things,

200
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,013
just dealing with electrons,
you can immediately say, I

201
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:58,019
start with 12 hydrogens
on this side.

202
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,075
Let me just write it this way.

203
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,002
So H12 on this side.

204
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:05,009
They all have a plus one
oxidation state.

205
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,036
And then cellular respiration
occurs.

206
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,088
And now I have 12 hydrogens.

207
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:11,044
I could write the 12 a little
bit differently here.

208
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,010
But they still have
a plus one.

209
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,076
Each of them still has a plus
one oxidation state.

210
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,087
So nothing from an oxidation
reduction point of view

211
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,067
happens to the hydrogen.

212
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,014
Now if we do the carbon.

213
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:25,005


214
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:27,064
On the left-hand side of the
equation, we have six carbons.

215
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:29,080
They have a neutral
oxidation state.

216
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,022
But then on the right-hand
side of the

217
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:32,089
equation, what happens?

218
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,029
I now have six carbons.

219
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,065
Written a little bit
differently.

220
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,016
But I have six carbons.

221
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:41,021
And they each have a plus
four oxidation state.

222
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:44,035
Which means that they have
lost four electrons.

223
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,087
Or their hypothetical charge,
by losing those four

224
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,074
electrons, has gone
up by four.

225
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:53,032
Because they're losing
negatively charged electrons.

226
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:57,079
So the six carbons, after
cellular respiration, end up

227
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,062
with six oxidized carbons,
with plus

228
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,036
four oxidation states.

229
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,038
Plus-- so each of these
lost four electrons.

230
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,060
We have six of them.

231
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,050
4 times 6 is 24 electrons.

232
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,019
These are the electrons that the
carbon lost. So we see in

233
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:17,073
cellular respiration that
the carbon is oxidized.

234
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:22,034


235
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:24,049
Oxidation is losing electrons.

236
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,062
We see in cellular respiration,
we draw the half

237
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:30,049
reaction, carbon is losing, the
six carbons are losing a

238
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,063
collective 24 electrons.

239
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,032
And then finally, if I were to
do the oxygen on this side.

240
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:39,088
I've lost my equation up here.

241
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:41,066
So over here I have
two oxygens.

242
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,029
And I'm going to draw them
a little bit separate.

243
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:48,053
So I have these six oxygens
here that have a minus two

244
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:50,028
oxidation state.

245
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,004
On the left-hand side.

246
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,003
So I'll draw it like this.

247
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:55,058
They have a minus two
oxidation state.

248
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:59,020
And then I have these
12 oxygens that

249
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,045
are completely neutral.

250
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:06,062


251
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:09,040
So I won't even write an
oxidation state or oxidation

252
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,042
number there.

253
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,092
And then after we
perform cellular

254
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:15,053
respiration, what happens?

255
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:21,039
Well now I have, in the carbon
dioxide, I have 12 carbons

256
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,027
that have a minus two
oxidation state.

257
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,002
Six times O2.

258
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:29,035
So let me write that down
from the carbon dioxide.

259
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,094
So I have six O2s that
all have a to

260
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:34,021
minus oxidation state.

261
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,099
And then I have another six
oxygens that have a minus two

262
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,089
oxidation state.

263
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:45,098
So plus six oxygens that have
a minus two oxidation state.

264
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:48,082
So if you think about it, over
here I had a collective

265
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,076
oxidation state on all
of the oxygens.

266
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,037
These were neutral.

267
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:54,073
I have 6 times minus 2,
that's a minus 12.

268
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:56,087
You can kind of view it
as collective charge

269
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,067
of all six of them.

270
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,084
6 times minus 2.

271
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:02,049
Here I have 6 times minus
2, which is minus 12.

272
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:06,026
And then I have 6 times 2
oxygens per molecule.

273
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,050
So that's 12 times minus 2.

274
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,027
That's minus 24.

275
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:14,005
So to go from a minus 12 to a
total oxidation or kind of

276
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,085
hypothetical charge of
minus 36, I must

277
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:20,078
have gained 24 electrons.

278
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,069
And those 24 electrons that
I gained, that the oxygens

279
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:28,007
gained, are the same 24
electrons that the carbons

280
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,060
lost. So from the chemistry
point of

281
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,021
view, it's very clear.

282
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,075
Carbon was oxidized.

283
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:41,012
And oxygen, which gained
electrons-- RIG.

284
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,075
Reduction is gaining.

285
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,015
Oxygen is reduced.

286
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,024
And this is all a
bit of review.

287
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:48,074
But it's nice to see it in
the context of cellular

288
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,058
respiration.

289
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:52,012
And this actually kind of
answers one of the questions

290
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:56,005
of where does this
energy come from?

291
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,086
In any of these chemical
reactions, when you see energy

292
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:01,034
being produced, it's because
electrons are going from a

293
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:04,012
higher energy state to
a lower energy state.

294
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:08,062
If I have an electron that's up
here in a high energy state

295
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:11,071
and it is able to go to a more
comfortable state, lower

296
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:13,085
orbital or lower
energy orbital.

297
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,084
So low energy or more
stable energy state.

298
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:20,025
It'll generate energy in the
form of heat, or maybe this

299
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:23,076
can do some work in some way,
help make ATP molecules.

300
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:26,020
And so when you see these half
reactions, you see these 24

301
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,054
electrons, that are being
lost by carbon,

302
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:30,053
carbon is being oxidized.

303
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,069
And they're going to oxygen.

304
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,059
They're going in a whole
series of steps.

305
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,087
It's not just happening
in one huge explosion.

306
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:40,007
It's happening over a huge
series of steps.

307
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,054
And as it does that, it's
entering lower and lower

308
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,062
energy states.

309
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:47,000
And as these electrons enter
the lower energy states,

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,070
essentially by going from the
carbons and being pushed to

311
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,073
the oxygens, that's where the
energy is coming from.

312
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:56,005
That's where the energy
to make the 38

313
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:57,059
ATPs is coming from.

314
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,054
So, so far we talked a little
bit about how a

315
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:01,088
chemist views oxidation.

316
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:04,062
I touched at the beginning of
the video of how a biologist

317
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:05,061
views oxidation.

318
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,099
And then we saw that cellular
respiration from a chemist's

319
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:10,080
point of view is clearly showing
that the carbon is

320
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,024
being oxidized.

321
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:15,073
It's losing electrons.

322
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:17,061
And that the oxygen
is being reduced.

323
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:19,019
It's gaining electrons.

324
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,052
It's being reduced.

325
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:24,075
That electrons are going from
this carbon and they're going,

326
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:28,010
essentially, to these
oxygens right here.

327
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,001
Now how does the biology
definition of our

328
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:30,076
position hold up?

329
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:32,058
Well here it holds
up pretty well.

330
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:35,091
Because you can imagine, over
here, all of the hydrogens in

331
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:39,049
the equation are associated
with glucose.

332
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,029
And so they're either bonded,
if you look at the structure

333
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:43,080
of glucose.

334
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,064
The hydrogens are either bonded
to carbons or oxygens.

335
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:50,035
So these are bonded to
carbons and oxygens.

336
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,062
And when you go on the
right-hand side of the

337
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:57,064
equation, all of the hydrogens
are only bonding with oxygen.

338
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:01,057
So net-net, carbon definitely
lost hydrogens.

339
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:05,012
And hydrogens and oxygen
definitely gained hydrogens.

340
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:06,055
Let me write that down.

341
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,074
We see in respiration, carbon
lost hydrogens.

342
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:14,075


343
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:16,046
And oxygen gained hydrogens.

344
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:21,065


345
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:23,001
And that's consistent.

346
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,002
Because we see that by losing
hydrogens we are being

347
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:27,097
oxidized from a biologist
point of view.

348
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:31,079
And by gaining hydrogens,
oxygen is being reduced.

349
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,012
And just so you can kind of
makes sense of this when you

350
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:37,027
see this-- and when I start
drawing out the mechanisms,

351
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:39,098
which I will hopefully not make
too hairy-- this process

352
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:42,078
of transferring these hydrogens
is facilitated by

353
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,048
molecules like NAD
plus and FAD.

354
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,017
And we'll see that.

355
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:50,060
But really, if we just want to
reconcile the two notions, as

356
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,051
the hydrogens are being
transferred from one

357
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:56,049
electronegative atom to another
electronegative atom,

358
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,048
what's really being transferred
is the opportunity

359
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,026
to hog electrons.

360
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:02,032
If carbon has the hydrogen, it
gets to hog the electrons.

361
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,066
But if that hydrogen goes from
the carbon-- and the whole

362
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:07,007
atom; not just the nucleus, but
the whole atom goes to the

363
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,011
oxygen-- now the oxygen
has gained that

364
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,052
electron that it can hog.

365
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:13,039
And carbon has lost
the electron.

366
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,022
So carbon has oxidized and
oxygen has been reduced.

367
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:18,075
And I mentioned this
in previous videos.

368
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:20,037
But probably the most confusing
thing about

369
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:23,084
oxidation is that you always
want to say, all right, that

370
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:25,020
must have something
to do with oxygen.

371
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,067
And it does.

372
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,012
The word really comes
from, what would

373
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:30,003
oxygen do to something?

374
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:33,067
So oxygen, when it bonds with
things, it loses, it takes

375
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,008
away their electrons.

376
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:38,051
Or, in a reaction, it'll often
take away the hydrogens.

377
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,091
It took away the hydrogens
from the

378
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,077
carbon in this situation.

379
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,050
So that's where the term
oxidation comes from.

380
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,012
But you don't have to have
oxygen anywhere in your

381
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:49,041
reaction for oxidation or
reduction to occur.

382
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,058
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.

383
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:54,096
This was actually a huge pain
point for me when I learned, I

384
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,097
got comfortable with the
chemistry definition of

385
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,023
oxidation reduction.

386
00:16:58,023 --> 00:16:59,097
And then all of a sudden you
open up your biology book and

387
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,097
they start talking about losing
and gaining hydrogens,

388
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:04,075
as opposed to electrons, and it
took me a while to really

389
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,047
reconcile these two notions.

390
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:07,069

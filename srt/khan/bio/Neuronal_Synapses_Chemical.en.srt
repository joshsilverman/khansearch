1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,067


2
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:04,004
I think we have a decent idea of
how a signal is transmitted

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,062
along the neuron.

4
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:08,080
We saw that a couple of
dendrites, maybe that one and

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,000
that one and that one, might
get excited or triggered.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,096
And when we say it gets
triggered, we're saying that

7
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,080
some type of channel
gets opened.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,028
That's probably the trigger.

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,078
That channel allows ions to be
released into the cell-- or

10
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:25,012
actually, there are situations
where ions can be released out

11
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:25,055
of the cell.

12
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,069
It would be inhibitory, but
let's take the case where ions

13
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:31,082
are released into the cells in
an electrotonic fashion.

14
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:35,050
It changes the charge or the
voltage gradient across the

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,075
membrane and if the combined
effects of the change in the

16
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:42,028
voltage gradient is just enough
at the axon hillock to

17
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:46,078
meet that threshold, then the
sodium channels over here will

18
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:51,003
open up, sodium floods in, and
then we have the situation

19
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:54,015
where the voltage becomes
very positive.

20
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:57,009
Potassium channels open up to
change things again, but by

21
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,071
the time we went very
positive, then that

22
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:03,032
eletrotonically affects
the next sodium pump.

23
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:06,073
But then we have the situation
where that will allow sodium

24
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:09,035
ions to flood in and then
the signal keeps getting

25
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,054
transmitted.

26
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:15,023
Now the next natural question
is, what happens at the neuron

27
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,059
to neuron junctions?

28
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,064
We said that this dendrite gets

29
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:21,054
triggered or gets excited.

30
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:24,004
In most cases, it's getting
triggered or excited by

31
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:24,081
another neuron.

32
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,034
It could be something else.

33
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:31,054
And over here, when this axon
fires, it should be exciting

34
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,051
either another cell.

35
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,076
It could be a muscle cell or--
in probably most cases of the

36
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:39,081
human body-- it's exciting
another neuron.

37
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,004
And so how does it do that?

38
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,014
So this is the terminal
end of the axon.

39
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:46,053
There could be the dendrite of
another neuron right here.

40
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:51,090


41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,043
This is another neuron with its
own axon, its own cell.

42
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:58,040
This would trigger the
dendrite right there.

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,018
So the question is, how
does that happen?

44
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:04,012
How does the signal go from one
neuron's axon to the next

45
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:04,098
neuron's dendrite?

46
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:07,076
It actually always doesn't
have to go from axon to

47
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:09,044
dendrite, but that's
the most typical.

48
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:12,046
You can actually go from axon to
axon, dendrite to dendrite,

49
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:16,003
axon to soma-- but let's just
focus on axon to dendrite

50
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:19,034
because that's the most
traditional way that neurons

51
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:22,018
transmit information from
one to the other.

52
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:22,099
So let's zoom in.

53
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,069
Let's zoom in right here.

54
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,061
This little box right there,
let's zoom at the base, the

55
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:31,074
terminal end of this axon
and let's zoom in

56
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,002
on this whole area.

57
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,000
Then we'll also zoom in-- we're
also going to get the

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,037
dendrite of this next neuron--
and I'm going to rotate it.

59
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,031
Actually, I don't even
have to rotate it.

60
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:42,094
So to do that, let me draw
the terminal end.

61
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:45,009
So let's say the terminal end
looks something like this.

62
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,021
I'm zoomed in big time.

63
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,090


64
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,009
This is the terminal
end of the neuron.

65
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:58,015
This is inside the neuron and
then the next dendrite-- let

66
00:02:58,015 --> 00:02:59,048
me draw it right here.

67
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:06,028


68
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,080
So we've really zoomed in.

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:17,009
So this is the dendrite
of the next neuron.

70
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,071
This is inside the
first neuron.

71
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:22,008
So we have this action
potential that

72
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,063
keeps traveling along.

73
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:27,058
Eventually for maybe right over
here-- I don't know if

74
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:30,096
you can zoom in-- which would
be over here, the action

75
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:34,068
potential makes the electrical
potential or the voltage

76
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:38,047
potential across this membrane
just positive enough to

77
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:42,040
trigger this sodium channel.

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,061
So actually, maybe
I'm really close.

79
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,075
This channel is this
one right here.

80
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:53,034
So then it allows a flood of
sodium to enter the cell.

81
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:56,011


82
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,056
And then the the whole
thing happens.

83
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,078
You have potassium that can then
take it out, but by the

84
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:03,034
time this comes in, this
positive charge, it can

85
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,093
trigger another channel and it
could trigger another sodium

86
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:09,024
channel if there's other sodium
channels further down,

87
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,075
but near the end of
the axon there are

88
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:15,046
actually calcium channels.

89
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,019
I'll do that in pink.

90
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,068
So this is a calcium channel
that is traditionally closed.

91
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,095
So this is a calcium
ion channel.

92
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,054
Calcium has a plus 2 charge.

93
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:30,006


94
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:33,023
It tends to be closed, but
it's also voltage gated.

95
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:37,095
When the voltage gets high
enough, it's very similar to a

96
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:41,067
sodium voltage gated channel is
that if it becomes positive

97
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:45,063
enough near the gate, it will
open up and when it opens up,

98
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:49,039
it allows calcium ions to
flood into the cell.

99
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,044
So the calcium ions, their
plus 2 charge, to

100
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,018
flood into the cells.

101
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:58,026
Now you're saying, hey Sal, why
are calcium ions flooding

102
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:58,098
into the cells?

103
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,066
These have positive charge.

104
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,052
I just thought you said that the
cell is becoming positive

105
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,012
because of all the sodium
flowing in.

106
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,030
Why would this calcium
want to flow in?

107
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,088
And the reason why it wants to
flow in is because the cell

108
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:14,093
also-- just like it pumps out
sodium and pumps in potassium,

109
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:19,099
the cell also has calcium ion
pumps and the mechanism is

110
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,012
nearly identical to what I
showed you on the sodium

111
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:26,008
potassium pump, but it just
deals with calcium.

112
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:30,055
So you literally have these
proteins that are sitting

113
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:31,081
across the membrane.

114
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,072
This is a phospobilipid
layer membrane.

115
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:38,056
Maybe I'll draw two layers here
just so you realize it's

116
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:41,047
a bi-layer membrane.

117
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,052
Let me draw it like that.

118
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:47,001
That makes it look a little bit
more realistic, although

119
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,067
the whole thing is not
very realistic.

120
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:52,077
And this is also going to
be a bilipid membrane.

121
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:56,066
You get the idea, but
let me just do it to

122
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:59,039
make the point clear.

123
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,062
So there are also these calcium
ion pumps that are

124
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:07,010
also subsets of ATPases, which
they're just like the sodium

125
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,018
potassium pumps.

126
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:13,072
You give them one ATP and a
calcium will bond someplace

127
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:20,024
else and it'll pull apart the
phosphate from the ATP and

128
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:22,094
that'll be enough energy to
change the confirmation of

129
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:25,072
this protein and it'll
push the calcium out.

130
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:29,004
Essentially, what was the
calcium will bond and then

131
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:33,050
it'll open up so the calcium
can only exit the cell.

132
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,035
It's just like the sodium
potassium pumps, but it's good

133
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:38,087
to know in the resting state,
you have a high concentration

134
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:42,019
of calcium ions out here and
it's all driven by ATP.

135
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,017
A much higher concentration on
the outside than you have on

136
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:47,087
the inside and it's driven
by those ion pumps.

137
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:50,098
So once you have this action
potential, instead of

138
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:54,036
triggering another sodium gate,
it starts triggering

139
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:58,062
calcium gates and these calcium
ions flood into the

140
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:01,018
terminal end of this axon.

141
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:05,081
Now, these calcium ions, they
bond to other proteins.

142
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,098
And before I go to those other
proteins, we have to keep in

143
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:12,023
mind what's going on near this
junction right here.

144
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:14,083
And I've used the word
synapse already--

145
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,010
actually, maybe I haven't.

146
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,024
The place where this axon is
meeting with this dendrite,

147
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,049
this is the synapse.

148
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:29,006


149
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:31,068
Or you can kind of view it as
the touching point or the

150
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:34,001
communication point or
the connection point.

151
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,048
And this neuron right
here, this is called

152
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,092
the presynaptic neuron.

153
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,073
Let me write that down.

154
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,066
It's good to have a little
terminology under our belt.

155
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:49,022


156
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,025
This is the post-synaptic
neuron.

157
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:58,055


158
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:02,074
And the space between the two
neurons, between this axon and

159
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:05,068
this dendrite, this is called
the synaptic cleft.

160
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:12,061


161
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:15,069
It's a really small space in the
terms of-- so what we're

162
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,089
going to deal with in this video
is a chemical synapse.

163
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,044
In general, when people talk
about synapses, they're

164
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,025
talking about chemical
synapses.

165
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,087
There also are electrical
synapses, but I won't go into

166
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,081
detail on those.

167
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:29,047
This is kind of the most
traditional one that people

168
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,064
talk about.

169
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:34,066
So your synaptic cleft in
chemical synapses is about 20

170
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:38,046
nanometers, which
is really small.

171
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:45,062
If you think about the average
width of a cell as about 10 to

172
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:49,014
100 microns-- this micron
is 10 to the minus 6.

173
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:52,015
This is 20 times 10 to
the minus 9 meters.

174
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,028
So this is a very small distance
and it makes sense

175
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:56,095
because look how big
the cells look next

176
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,003
to this small distance.

177
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:02,021
So it's a very small distance
and you have-- on the

178
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:05,037
presynaptic neuron near
the terminal end,

179
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:06,075
you have these vesicles.

180
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,076
Remember what vesicles were.

181
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:13,091
These are just membrane bound
things inside of the cell.

182
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:16,012
So you have these vesicles.

183
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:20,075
They also have their
phospobilipid layers, their

184
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:21,036
little membranes.

185
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,059
So you have these vesicles so
these are just-- you can kind

186
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,035
of view them as containers.

187
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:31,001
I'll just draw one more
just like that.

188
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:34,005
And they can train these
molecules called

189
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,051
neurotransmitters and
I'll draw the

190
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:41,027
neurotransmitters in green.

191
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,078
So they have these
molecules called

192
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,013
neurotransmitters in them.

193
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:48,040
You've probably heard
the word before.

194
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,004
In fact, a lot of drugs that
people use for depression or

195
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:59,037
other things related to our
mental state, they affect

196
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:01,010
neurotransmitters.

197
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,072
I won't go into detail there,
but they contain these

198
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:04,071
neurotransmitters.

199
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,080
And when the calcium channels--
they're voltage

200
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,036
gated-- when it becomes a little
more positive, they

201
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:15,030
open calcium floods in and what
the calcium does is, it

202
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,082
bonds to these proteins that
have docked these vesciles.

203
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:26,016
So these little vesicles,
they're docked to the

204
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:30,042
presynpatic membrane or to this
axon terminal membrane

205
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:30,082
right there.

206
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:33,051
These proteins are actually
called SNARE proteins.

207
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:36,028
It's an acronym, but it's also
a good word because they've

208
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:39,053
literally snared the vesicles
to this membrane.

209
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,047
So that's what these
proteins are.

210
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:45,080
And when these calcium ions
flood in, they bond to these

211
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,097
proteins, they attach to these
proteins, and they change the

212
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:53,085
confirmation of the proteins
just enough that these

213
00:10:53,085 --> 00:11:00,061
proteins bring these vesicles
closer to the membrane and

214
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:03,009
also kind of pull apart the
two membranes so that the

215
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,003
membranes merge.

216
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:07,017
Let me do a zoom in of that
just to make it clear

217
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:08,037
what's going on.

218
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:11,070
So after they've bonded-- this
is kind of before the calcium

219
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,007
comes in, bonds to those SNARE
proteins, then the SNARE

220
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:20,019
protein will bring the vesicle
ultra-close to

221
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,058
the presynaptic membrane.

222
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:25,071
So that's the vesicle and then
the presynaptic membrane will

223
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:32,037
look like this and then you
have your SNARE proteins.

224
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:34,055
And I'm not obviously drawing it
exactly how it looks in the

225
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:37,021
cell, but it'll give you the
idea of what's going on.

226
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:42,000
Your SNARE proteins have
essentially pulled the things

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,050
together and have pulled them
apart so that these two

228
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,077
membranes merge.

229
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:48,004
And then the main side effect--
the reason why all

230
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,035
this is happening-- is it allows
those neurotransmitters

231
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:54,007
to be dumped into the
synaptic cleft.

232
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:57,098
So those neurotransmitters
that were inside of our

233
00:11:57,098 --> 00:12:01,036
vesicle then get dumped into
the synaptic cleft.

234
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:04,084


235
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:07,062
This process right here
is called exocytosis.

236
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:12,016
It's exiting the cytoplasm,
you could say, of the

237
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,021
presynaptic neuron.

238
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,012
These neurotransmitters-- and
you've probably heard the

239
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:20,055
specific names of many of
these-- serotonin, dopamine,

240
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:23,076
epinephrine-- which is also
adrenaline, but that's also a

241
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,012
hormone, but it also acts
as a neurotransmitter.

242
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,037
Norepinephrine, also both
a hormone and a

243
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:29,083
neurotransmitter.

244
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,082
So these are words that you've
probably heard before.

245
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:36,007
But anyway, these enter into
the synaptic cleft and then

246
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:43,077
they bond on the surface
of the membrane of the

247
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,010
post-synaptic neuron
or this dendrite.

248
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,090


249
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,088
Let's say they bond here, they
bond here, and they bond here.

250
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:56,055
So they bond on special proteins
on this membrane

251
00:12:56,055 --> 00:13:02,000
surface, but the main effect of
that is, that will trigger

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,020
ion channels.

253
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,087
So let's say that this neuron
is exciting this dendrite.

254
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:11,053
So when these neurotransmitters
bond on this

255
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:14,077
membrane, maybe sodium
channels open up.

256
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:18,064
So maybe that will cause a
sodium channel to open up.

257
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,024
So instead of being voltage
gated, it's

258
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,004
neurotransmitter gated.

259
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,095
So this will cause a sodium
channel to open up and then

260
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,035
sodium will flow in and then,
just like we said before, if

261
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,097
we go to the original one,
that's like this getting

262
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:34,067
excited, it'll become a little
bit positive and then if it's

263
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:38,087
enough positive, it'll
electrotonically increase the

264
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,025
potential at this point on the
axon hillock and then we'll

265
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:45,060
have another neuron-- in this
case, this neuron being

266
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,037
stimulated.

267
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,007
So that's essentially
how it happens.

268
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,015
It actually could
be inhibitory.

269
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:54,086
You could imagine if this,
instead of triggering a sodium

270
00:13:54,086 --> 00:14:00,034
ion channel, if it triggered
a potassium ion channel.

271
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:04,045
If it triggered a potassium ion
channel, potassium ion's

272
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:06,039
concentration gradient will
make it want to go

273
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,089
outside of the cell.

274
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,074
So positive things are
going to leave the

275
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,087
cell if it's potassium.

276
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:14,042
Remember, I used triangles
for potassium.

277
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:18,042
And so if positive things leave
the cell, then if you go

278
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:21,054
further down the neuron, it'll
become less positive and so

279
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:25,051
it'll be even harder for the
action potential to start up

280
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:29,004
because it'll need even more
positive someplace else to

281
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,037
make the threshold gradient.

282
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,029
I hope I'm not confusing
you when I say that.

283
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:33,096
So this connection,
the way I first

284
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:35,024
described it, it's exciting.

285
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:38,013
When this guy gets excited
from an action potential,

286
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:39,062
calcium floods in.

287
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:43,067
It makes these vesicles dump
their contents in the synaptic

288
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:49,067
cleft and then that will make
other sodium gates open up and

289
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,092
then that will stimulate this
neuron, but if it makes

290
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:55,004
potassium gates open up, then
it will inhibit it-- and

291
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:59,051
that's how, frankly, these
synapses work.

292
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:01,060
I was about to say there's
millions of synapses, but

293
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,048
that'd be incorrect.

294
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,084
There's trillions of synapses.

295
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:07,087
The best estimate of the number
of synapses in our

296
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:18,099
cerebral cortex is 100 to 500
trillion synapses just in the

297
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,086
cerebral cortex.

298
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,045
The reason why we can have so
many is that one neuron can

299
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:25,084
actually form many, many,
many, many synapses.

300
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:27,074
I mean, you can imagine if this
original drawing of a

301
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:29,075
cell, you might have a synapse
here, a synapse here, a

302
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,060
synapse there.

303
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,067
You could have hundreds or
thousands of synapses even,

304
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,012
into one neuron or going
out of one neuron.

305
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:38,024
This might be a synapse with
one neuron, another one,

306
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,025
another one, another one.

307
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:42,025
So you'd have many, many, many,
many, many connections.

308
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:47,022
And so synapses are really what
give us the complexity of

309
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:50,039
what probably make us tick in
terms of our human mind and

310
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,098
all of that.

311
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:53,038
But anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.

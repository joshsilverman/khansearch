1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,071


2
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:03,035
So we already know that if we
start off with a glucose

3
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:12,024
molecule, which is a 6-carbon
molecule, that this

4
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:15,088
essentially gets split in half
by glycolysis and we end up 2

5
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:19,076
pyruvic acids or two
pyruvate molecules.

6
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:23,023
So glycolysis literally
splits this in half.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,019
It lyses the glucose.

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,076
We end up with two pyruvates
or pyruvic acids.

9
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:35,035
ruby And these are 3-carbon
molecules.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,057
There's obviously a
lot of other stuff

11
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,047
going on in the carbons.

12
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,046
You saw it in the past. And
you could look up their

13
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:42,021
chemical structures on the
internet or on Wikipedia and

14
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:42,093
see them in detail.

15
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,021
But this is kind of the
important thing.

16
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,077
Is that it was lysed,
it was cut in half.

17
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:48,002
And this is what happened
in glycolysis.

18
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:54,002


19
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:56,064
And this happened in the
absence of oxygen.

20
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,021
Or not necessarily.

21
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:00,085
It can happen in the presence
or in the absence of oxygen.

22
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:02,052
It doesn't need oxygen.

23
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:04,042
And we got a net payoff
of two ATPs.

24
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:08,050


25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,026
And I always say the net there,
because remember, it

26
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:14,098
used two ATPs in that investment
stage, and then it

27
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:16,006
generated four.

28
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,098
So on a net basis, it generated
four, used two, it

29
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,079
gave us two ATPs.

30
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,057
And it also produced
two NADHs.

31
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:28,015


32
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:30,054
That's what we got out
of glycolysis.

33
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:33,015
And just so you can visualize
this a little bit better, let

34
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:35,060
me draw a cell right here.

35
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,051
Maybe I'll draw it down here.

36
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:41,034
Let's say I have a cell.

37
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,001
That's its outer membrane.

38
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,045
Maybe its nucleus, we're
dealing with

39
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,000
a eukaryotic cell.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
That doesn't have
to be the case.

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,078
It has its DNA and its chromatin
form all spread

42
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:52,004
around like that.

43
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,048
And then you have
mitochondria.

44
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:56,000
And there's a reason why people
call it the power

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,081
centers of the cell.

46
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,060
We'll look at that
in a second.

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,029
So there's a mitochondria.

48
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:01,009
It has an outer membrane
and an inner

49
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,037
membrane just like that.

50
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:05,081
I'll do more detail on the
structure of a mitochondria,

51
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,037
maybe later in this video
or maybe I'll do a

52
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,080
whole video on them.

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,087
That's another mitochondria
right there.

54
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:15,012
And then all of this fluid,
this space out here that's

55
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:17,088
between the organelles-- and
the organelles, you kind of

56
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:22,071
view them as parts of the cell
that do specific things.

57
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,069
Kind of like organs
do specific things

58
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,021
within our own bodies.

59
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,005
So this-- so between all of the
organelles you have this

60
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,047
fluidic space.

61
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,009
This is just fluid
of the cell.

62
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,034
And that's called
the cytoplasm.

63
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:37,081


64
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:41,056
And that's where glycolysis
occurs.

65
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,043
So glycolysis occurs
in the cytoplasm.

66
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:47,036


67
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:50,061
Now we all know-- in the
overview video-- we know what

68
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,015
the next step is.

69
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:54,099
The Krebs cycle, or the
citric acid cycle.

70
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,076
And that actually takes place
in the inner membrane, or I

71
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:03,034
should say the inner space
of these mitochondria.

72
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,081
Let me draw it a little
bit bigger.

73
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,088
Let me draw a mitochondria
here.

74
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,059
So this is a mitochondria.

75
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,034
It has an outer membrane.

76
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,096
It has an inner membrane.

77
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:14,094
If I have just one inner
membrane we call it a crista.

78
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,043
If we have many, we
call them cristae.

79
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:19,056
This little convoluted
inner membrane, let

80
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:22,040
me give it a label.

81
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,043
So they are cristae, plural.

82
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:27,053
And then it has two
compartments.

83
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:29,093
Because it's divided by
these two membranes.

84
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,087
This compartment right here is
called the outer compartment.

85
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,034
This whole thing right there,
that's the outer compartment.

86
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:39,065
And then this inner compartment
in here, is called

87
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,090
the matrix.

88
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,019


89
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,027
Now you have these pyruvates,
they're not quite just ready

90
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:53,021
for the Krebs cycle, but I
guess-- well that's a good

91
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,091
intro into how do you
make them ready

92
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,059
for the Krebs cycle?

93
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,043
They actually get oxidized.

94
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:00,090
And I'll just focus on one
of these pyruvates.

95
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,074
We just have to remember that
the pyruvate, that this

96
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:06,072
happens twice for every
molecule of glucose.

97
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:09,065
So we have this kind
of preparation step

98
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,087
for the Krebs Cycle.

99
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,012
We call that pyruvate
oxidation.

100
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:17,000


101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,086
And essentially what it does
is it cleaves one of these

102
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:22,031
carbons off of the pyruvate.

103
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,064
And so you end up with
a 2-carbon compound.

104
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't have just two carbons,
but its backbone of

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,074
carbons is just two carbons.

106
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,099
Called acetyl-CoA.

107
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:35,004


108
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,010
And if these names are
confusing, because what is

109
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,058
acetyl coenzyme A?

110
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,037
These are very bizarre.

111
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,002
You could do a web search on
them But I'm just going to use

112
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,036
the words right now, because it
will keep things simple and

113
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:44,079
we'llget the big picture.

114
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,024
So it generates acetyl-CoA,
which is

115
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:47,050
this 2-carbon compound.

116
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:56,050
And it also reduces some
NAD plus to NADH.

117
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,000
And this process right here is
often given credit-- or the

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Krebs cycle or the citric
acid cycle gets

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,006
credit for this step.

120
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:06,047
But it's really a preparation
step for the Krebs cycle.

121
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:11,087
Now once you have this 2-carbon
chain, acetyl-Co-A

122
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,075
right here.

123
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:16,019
you are ready to jump into
the Krebs cycle.

124
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,007
This long talked-about
Krebs cycle.

125
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,067
And you'll see in a second
why it's called a cycle.

126
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,097
Acetyl-CoA, and all of this
is catalyzed by enzymes.

127
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:26,089
And enzymes are just proteins
that bring together the

128
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,054
constituent things that need to
react in the right way so

129
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:30,097
that they do react.

130
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,025
So catalyzed by enzymes.

131
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:40,027
This acetyl-CoA merges with
some oxaloacetic acid.

132
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:41,054
A very fancy word.

133
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,087
But this is a 4-carbon
molecule.

134
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:48,008


135
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:51,057
These two guys are kind of
reacted together, or merged

136
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,056
together, depending on how
you want to view it.

137
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,063
I'll draw it like that.

138
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,010
It's all catalyzed by enzymes.

139
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,000
And this is important.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,020
Some texts will say, is this an
enzyme catalyzed reaction?

141
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,074
Yes.

142
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:02,006
Everything in the Krebs
cycle is an

143
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:03,072
enzyme catalyzed reaction.

144
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,067
And they form citrate,
or citric acid.

145
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,062


146
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:11,047
Which is the same stuff
in your lemonade

147
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,081
or your orange juice.

148
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:18,032
And this is a 6-carbon
molecule.

149
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:18,099
Which makes sense.

150
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,016
You have a 2-carbon
and a 4-carbon.

151
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,051
You get a 6-carbon molecule.

152
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:27,000
And then the citric acid
is then oxidized

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,011
over a bunch of steps.

154
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,044
And this is a huge
simplification here.

155
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:33,054
But it's just oxidized over
a bunch of steps.

156
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:35,091
Again, the carbons
are cleaved off.

157
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:39,043
Both 2-carbons are cleaved
off of it to get back to

158
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,041
oxaloacetic acid.

159
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,062
And you might be saying, when
these carbons are cleaved off,

160
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:45,062
like when this carbon
is cleaved off,

161
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:48,056
what happens to it?

162
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,000
It becomes CO2.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,088
It gets put onto some oxygen
and leaves the system.

164
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:56,083
So this is where the oxygen or
the carbons, or the carbon

165
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,025
dioxide actually gets formed.

166
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,038
And similarly, when these
carbons get cleaved

167
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,017
off, it forms CO2.

168
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:06,072
And actually, for every molecule
of glucose you have

169
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:07,098
six carbons.

170
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:11,075
When you do this whole process
once, you are generating three

171
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:13,050
molecules of carbon dioxide.

172
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,062
But you're going
to do it twice.

173
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:18,000
You're going to have six carbon
dioxides produced.

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,097
Which accounts for all
of the carbons.

175
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:24,008
You get rid of three carbons
for every turn of this.

176
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,036
Well, two for every turn.

177
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:28,039
But really, for the steps after
glycolysis you get rid

178
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,039
of three carbons.

179
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,049
But you're going to do it for
each of the pyruvates.

180
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:34,035
You're going to get rid of all
six carbons, which will have

181
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,080
to exhale eventually.

182
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,093
But this cycle, it doesn't
just generate carbons.

183
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:43,014
The whole idea is to generate
NADHs and FADH2s and ATPs.

184
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:44,043
So we'll write that here.

185
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,081
And this is a huge
simplification.

186
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,093
I'll show you the detailed
picture in a second.

187
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:51,073
We'll reduce some NAD
plus into NADH.

188
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:56,002


189
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:57,012
We'll do it again.

190
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,086
And of course, these are
in separate steps.

191
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,024
There's intermediate
compounds.

192
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:03,019
I'll show you those
in a second.

193
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:08,012
Another NAD plus molecule
will be reduced to NADH.

194
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,004
It will produce some ATP.

195
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,062


196
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,017
Some ADP will turn into ATP.

197
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:18,092


198
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:22,018
Maybe we have some-- and not
maybe, this is what happens--

199
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:30,014
some FAD gets-- let me write
it this way-- some FAD gets

200
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:32,010
oxidized into FADH2.

201
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,095
And the whole reason why we even
pay attention to these,

202
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:37,085
you might think, hey cellular
respiration is all about ATP.

203
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:40,085
Why do we even pay attention
to these NADHs and these

204
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:44,090
FADH2s that get produced
as part of the process?

205
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,042
The reason why we care is that
these are the inputs into the

206
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,087
electron transport chain.

207
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:51,073
These get oxidized, or they lose
their hydrogens in the

208
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,052
electron transport chain, and
that's where the bulk of the

209
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:56,050
ATP is actually produced.

210
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,090
And then maybe we'll have
another NAD get reduced, or

211
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,088
gain in hydrogen.

212
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:03,077
Reduction is gaining
an electron.

213
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:06,075
Or gaining a hydrogen whose
electron you can hog.

214
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,087
NADH.

215
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:12,016
And then we end up back
at oxaloacetic acid.

216
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:15,057
And we can perform the whole
citric acid cycle over again.

217
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:17,046
So now that we've written it
all out, let's account for

218
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:21,017
what we have. So depending on--
let me draw some dividing

219
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,088
lines so we know what's what.

220
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:26,087
So this right here, everything
to the left of that line right

221
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,012
there is glycolysis.

222
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:30,045


223
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,075
We learned that already.

224
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:34,051
And then most-- especially
introductory-- textbooks will

225
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:38,048
give the Krebs cycle credit for
this pyruvate oxidation,

226
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:40,050
but that's really a
preparatory stage.

227
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,009
The Krebs cycle is really
formally this part where you

228
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,030
start with acetyl-CoA,
you merge it

229
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,039
with oxaloacetic acid.

230
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,019
And then you go and you form
citric acid, which essentially

231
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,021
gets oxidized and produces all
of these things that will need

232
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:57,075
to either directly produce ATP
or will do it indirectly in

233
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:59,002
the electron transport chain.

234
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:01,078
But let's account for everything
that we have. Let's

235
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,062
account for everything
that we have so far.

236
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,049
We already accounted for the
glycolysis right there.

237
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:10,011
Two net ATPs, two NADHs.

238
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:13,036
Now, in the citric acid cycle,
or in the Krebs cycle, well

239
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,073
first we have our pyruvate
oxidation.

240
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:16,067
That produced one NADH.

241
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:19,083


242
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,003
But remember, if we want to say,
what are we producing for

243
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,060
every glucose?

244
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,042
This is what we produced for
each of the pyruvates.

245
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,050
This NADH was from just
this pyruvate.

246
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,062
But glycolysis produced
two pyruvates.

247
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:38,012
So everything after this, we're
going to multiply by two

248
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,057
for every molecule of glucose.

249
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:43,067
So I'll say, for the pyruvate
oxidation times two means that

250
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,008
we got two NADHs.

251
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:52,005


252
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:55,089
And then when we look at this
side, the formal Krebs cycle,

253
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,079
what do we get?

254
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,014
We have, how many NADHs?

255
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:02,011
One, two, three NADHs.

256
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:07,073
So three NADHs times two,
because we're going to perform

257
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:10,051
this cycle for each of the
pyruvates produced from

258
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,096
glycolysis.

259
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:16,016
So that gives us six NADHs.

260
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:19,063
We have one ATP per
turn of the cycle.

261
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:20,073
That's going to happen twice.

262
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,040
Once for each pyruvic acid.

263
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,098
So we get two ATPs.

264
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:29,025
And then we have one FADH2.

265
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,049
But it's good, we're going
to do this cycle twice.

266
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:32,038
This is per cycle.

267
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:34,001
So times two.

268
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:37,042
We have two FADHs.

269
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:42,002
Now, sometimes in a lot of books
these two NADHs, or per

270
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,039
turn of the Krebs cycle, or per
pyruvate this one NADH,

271
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,002
they'll give credit to the
Krebs cycle for that.

272
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,016
So sometimes instead of having
this intermediate step,

273
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:52,055
they'll just write four
NADHs right here.

274
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:53,059
And you'll do it twice.

275
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:55,001
Once for each puruvate.

276
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,038
So they'll say eight NADHs get
produced from the Krebs cycle.

277
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:01,012
But the reality is, six from the
Krebs cycle two from the

278
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,094
preparatory stage.

279
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:06,012
Now the interesting thing is we
can account whether we get

280
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:10,036
to the 38 ATPs promised by
cellular respiration.

281
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:13,016
We've directly already produced,
for every molecule

282
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:17,020
of glucose, two ATPs and
then two more ATPs.

283
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,099
So we have four ATPs.

284
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,087
Four ATPs.

285
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,082
How many NADHs do we have?

286
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:25,036
2, 4, and then 4 plus 6 10.

287
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:29,085
We have 10 NADHs.

288
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,037
And then we have 2 FADH2s.

289
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:36,047


290
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,071
I think in the first
video on cellular

291
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:39,007
respiration I said FADH.

292
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:42,086
It should be FADH2, just to be
particular about things.

293
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:45,069
And these, so you might say,
hey, where are our 38 ATPs?

294
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,072
We only have four
ATPs right now.

295
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:51,060
But these are actually the
inputs in the electron

296
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,035
transport chain.

297
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:55,037
These molecules right here get
oxidized in the electron

298
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,046
transport chain.

299
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:59,046
Every NADH in the electron
transport chain

300
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,089
produces three ATPs.

301
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:08,012
So these 10 NADHs are going
to produce 30 ATPs in the

302
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,052
electron transport chain.

303
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:14,080
And each FADH2, when it gets
oxidized and gets turned back

304
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,016
into FAD in the electron
transport chain,

305
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:19,061
will produce two ATPs.

306
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:25,004
So two of them are going to
produce four ATPs in the

307
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,032
electron transport chain.

308
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,013
So we now see, we get
four from just what

309
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:29,096
we've done so far.

310
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:33,020
Glycolysis, the preparatory
stage and the Krebs or citric

311
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,022
acid cycle.

312
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,033
And then eventually, these
outputs from glycolysis and

313
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,092
the citric acid cycle, when
they get into the electron

314
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:42,069
transport chain, are going
to produce another 34.

315
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:48,037
So 34 plus 4, it does get us
to the promised 38 ATP that

316
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:51,084
you would expect in a
super-efficient cell.

317
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:53,062
This is kind of your theoretical
maximum.

318
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:55,083
In most cells they really
don't get quite there.

319
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,012
But this is a good number to
know if you're going to take

320
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:01,067
the AP bio test or in most
introductory biology courses.

321
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,057
There's one other point
I want to make here.

322
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:06,078
Everything we've talked about
so far, this is carbohydrate

323
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,037
metabolism.

324
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,029
Or sugar catabolism,
we could call it.

325
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,085
We're breaking down sugars
to produce ATP.

326
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:13,077
Glucose was our starting
point.

327
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:18,002
But animals, including us, we
can catabolize other things.

328
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,087
We can catabolize proteins.

329
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:26,023
We can catabolize fats.

330
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:29,009
If you have any fat on your
body, you have energy.

331
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,029
In theory, your body should be
able to take that fat and you

332
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,073
should be able to do
things with that.

333
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,075
You should be able
to generate ATP.

334
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:37,025
And the interesting thing, the
reason why I bring it up here,

335
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:39,087
is obviously glycolysis is of
no use to these things.

336
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:44,020
Although fats can be turned
into glucose in the liver.

337
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,021
But the interesting thing is
that the Krebs cycle is the

338
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:51,000
entry point for these other
catabolic mechanisms. Proteins

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,089
can be broken down into amino
acids, which can be broken

340
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,042
down into acetyl-CoA.

341
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:58,054
Fats can be turned into glucose,
which actually could

342
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:01,007
then go the whole cellular
respiration.

343
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:05,001
But the big picture here is
acetyl-CoA is the general

344
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,029
catabolic intermediary that can
then enter the Krebs cycle

345
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,020
and generate ATP regardless
of whether our fuel is

346
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,088
carbohydrates, sugars,
proteins or fats.

347
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:20,075
Now, we have a good sense of how
everything works out right

348
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:22,021
now, I think.

349
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,088
Now I'm going to show you a
diagram that you might see in

350
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,070
your biology textbook.

351
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,025
Or I'll actually show you the
actual diagram from Wikipedia.

352
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,064
I just want to show you,
this looks very

353
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,094
daunting and very confusing.

354
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:36,057
And I think that's why many of
us have trouble with cellular

355
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,066
respiration initially.

356
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,072
Because there's just so
much information.

357
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,065
It's hard to process
what's important.

358
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,063
But I want to just highlight
the important steps here.

359
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:46,020
Just so you see it's the same
thing that we talked about.

360
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,007
From glycolysis you produce
two pyruvates.

361
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,029
That's the pyruvate
right there.

362
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,003
They actually show its
molecular structure.

363
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,087
This is the pyruvate oxidation
step that I talked about.

364
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,057
The preparatory step.

365
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:58,066
And you see we produce
a carbon dioxide.

366
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:03,051
And we reduce NAD
plus into NADH.

367
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:06,090
Then we're ready to enter
the Krebs cycle.

368
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,023
The acetyl-CoA and the
oxaloacetate or oxaloacetic

369
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:14,049
acid, they are reacted
together to

370
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,086
create citric acid.

371
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:18,017
They've actually drawn
the molecule there.

372
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:21,011
And then the citric acid is
oxidized through the Krebs

373
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,025
cycle right there.

374
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,022
All of these steps, each
of these steps are

375
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,059
facilitated by enzymes.

376
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,010
And it gets oxidized.

377
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,089
But I want to highlight
the interesting parts.

378
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,096
Here we have an NAD get
reduced to NADH.

379
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:36,095
We have another NAD get
reduced to NADH.

380
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,096
And then over here, another
NAD gets reduced to NADH.

381
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:43,075
So, so far, if you include the
preparatory step, we've had

382
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:47,054
four NADHs formed, three
directly from the Krebs cycle.

383
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:49,012
That's just what I told you.

384
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,022
Now we have, in this diagram
they say GDP.

385
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:55,030
GTP gets formed from GDP.

386
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,075
The GTP is just guanosine
triphosphate.

387
00:16:57,075 --> 00:17:01,012
It's another purine that can
be a source of energy.

388
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:03,057
But then that later can be
used to form an ATP.

389
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,052
So this is just the way they
happen to draw it.

390
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:07,068
But this is the actual ATP
that I drew in the

391
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,006
diagram on the top.

392
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,021
And then they have
this Q group.

393
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,021
And I won't go into it.

394
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:14,025
And then it gets reduced
over here.

395
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,066
It gets those two hydrogens.

396
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:19,040
But that essentially ends
up reducing the FADH2s.

397
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,026
So this is where the FADH2
gets produced.

398
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:28,011
So as promised, we produced,
for each pyruvate that

399
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,027
inputted-- remember, so we're
going to do it twice-- for

400
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:35,099
each pyruvate we produced one,
two, three, four NADHs.

401
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,054
We produced one ATP
and one FADH2.

402
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:45,004
That's exactly what
we saw up here.

403
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll see you in the
next video.

1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,094
In its most popular sense,
when people talk about

2
00:00:03,094 --> 00:00:08,031
mitosis, they're referring to
a cell, a diploid cell.

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:10,067
So diploid just means it has
its full complement of

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:13,077
chromosomes, so it has
2N chromosomes.

5
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:15,094
So that's the nucleus.

6
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:17,041
This is the whole cell.

7
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,096
And so most people are saying,
look, the cell itself

8
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:23,058
replicates into two diploid
cells, so it turns into two

9
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:29,071
cells, each that have a full
complement of chromosomes, 2N

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,064
chromosomes.

11
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,039
And so when people say a cell
has experienced mitosis, they

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,057
normally mean this.

13
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:37,085
But I want to make one slight
clarification, that formally,

14
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:42,011
mitosis only refers to the
process of the replication of

15
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:45,035
the genetic material
and the nucleus.

16
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:50,017
So, for example, if I were to
draw this-- let me draw the

17
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:54,029
cell-- and it has now two
nucleuses, each with the

18
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:57,077
diploid number of chromosomes,
this cell

19
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:59,003
has experienced mitosis.

20
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,086


21
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:05,003
It has not experienced
cytokinesis, which we will

22
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,073
talk about in a few moments, but
that's the process of the

23
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:12,043
actual cytoplasm of the
cell being split into

24
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,048
two different cells.

25
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:17,015
And just as a clarity, the
cytoplasm is all the stuff

26
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:21,062
outside of the nucleus.

27
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,059
So I'll talk about that in a
second, but just know in

28
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,068
everyday usage, this is normally
the case when people

29
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:26,067
talk about mitosis.

30
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,085
But if you've got a teacher
that likes to get you on a

31
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:31,073
technicality, this is
technically what mitosis is.

32
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:35,003
It's the splitting of the
nucleus or the replication of

33
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,045
the nucleus into two
separate nucleuses.

34
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:42,081
That's normally accompanied
by cytokinesis where the

35
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,093
cytoplasms of the cells
actually separate.

36
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:51,025
Now, with that said, let's go
into the mechanics of mitosis.

37
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:55,015
So the first steps that are
really necessary for mitosis

38
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,092
actually occur outside of
mitosis when the cell is just

39
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:02,088
doing its day-to-day life, and
that's during the interphase.

40
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:07,056


41
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:10,044
And the interphase, literally
it's not a phase of mitosis.

42
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:14,081
It's literally when the
cell is just living.

43
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,072
Let's say we have
some new cell.

44
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,046
Let me do it in green.

45
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,043
That's a new cell here.

46
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,078
Maybe this is its nucleus.

47
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:29,062
It's got 2N chromosomes,
and then it grows.

48
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:32,078
It brings in nutrients from
the outside and builds

49
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:37,065
proteins and does whatever,
and so it grows a bit.

50
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:42,061
It's obviously got its full
chromosomal complement still.

51
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:46,008
And then at some point during
this life cycle, and I'll

52
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:49,021
label these actually, so this
phase in interphase, and this

53
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:52,046
might not even be covered in
some biology classes, but they

54
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,006
give it a label.

55
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,065
They call it G1, which
is really just

56
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:58,037
when the cell is growing.

57
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:00,084
It's just growing, accumulating
materials and

58
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:05,099
building itself out, and then
it actually replicates its

59
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,077
chromosomes.

60
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,075
So you still have a diploid
number of chromosomes.

61
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,038
So let me zoom in.

62
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,015
So let me draw this.

63
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:16,049
This is called the S phase of
interphase, so this is S.

64
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,018
And S is where you have
replication of the actual

65
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:19,043
chromosomes.

66
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,034
Once again, we're not
even in mitosis yet.

67
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:28,090
So S, you have replication
of your chromosomes.

68
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,077
So if I were to zoom in on the
nucleus during the S phase, if

69
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:38,022
I were to start off-- let me
just start with some organism

70
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:40,093
that has two chromosomes.

71
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:45,021
So let's say that at the
beginning of S phase, and I'll

72
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:48,006
draw things as chromosomes just
to make it clear that

73
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,030
things are being replicated.

74
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,000
So let me say it has this
chromosome right here and then

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
let's say it has this chromosome
right here.

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,018
As it goes through S phase,
these chromosomes replicate.

77
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:02,043
And I'm just drawing
the nucleus here.

78
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:05,074
I've zoomed in on just this part
right here, where N is 1,

79
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:10,005
where our full diploid
complement is two chomosomes.

80
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:16,000
During S phase, our chromosomes
will replicate and

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,026
will have-- so that green one
will completely replicate and

82
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:24,022
generate a copy of itself, and
we've learned this a little

83
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,037
bit, they're connected
at the centromere.

84
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:30,036
Now, each of those copies are
called chromatids, and that

85
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,035
magenta one will do
the same thing.

86
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:38,025
Even though we have two
chromatids, one for each

87
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:41,017
chromosome, now we have four
chromatids, two for each

88
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:45,012
chromosome, we still say we
only have two chromosomes.

89
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,000
That's its centromere
right there.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,041
This occurs in the S phase, and
then the cell will just

91
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,070
continue to grow more.

92
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,016
So the cell was already big--
I'll focus on the cell again.

93
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,072
The cell was already big
and it gets bigger.

94
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:05,093
It gets bigger, and that's
during the G2 phase, so it's

95
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:09,037
just growing more.

96
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:12,039
Now, there's another little part
of the cell we haven't

97
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,089
even talked about yet,
but I'll talk

98
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,080
about it a little bit.

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,057
It's not super-duper important,
but it's the idea

100
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,000
of these centrosomes.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,052
These are going to be very
important later on when the

102
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:25,017
cell is actually dividing,
and those also duplicate.

103
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:27,026
So let's say I have a little
centrosome here.

104
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,086


105
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,093
It has centrioles inside it.

106
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,081
You don't have to worry too much
about that, but they're

107
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:36,037
these little cylindrical-looking
things.

108
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,056
But I just want to-- so you
don't get confused if you see

109
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:41,070
the word centriole and
centrosomes, not to be

110
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,068
confused with centromeres, which
are these little points

111
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:46,075
where the two chromatids
attach.

112
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:51,063
Unfortunately, they named many
things in this process very

113
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,051
similarly, or a lot
of the parts

114
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,058
of a cell very similarly.

115
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:57,031
But you have these things called
centrosomes that are

116
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,072
going to enter the picture very
soon, that are sitting

117
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:05,025
outside of the nucleus, and
they also replicate.

118
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:08,027
They also replicate during
the interphase.

119
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:11,010
So you had one before, now
you have two of them.

120
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,052
And, of course, they each have
their two little centrioles

121
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:15,093
inside, but we're not going
to focus too much

122
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,001
on those just yet.

123
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,045
So that's what happened
in the interphase.

124
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:23,027
This is most of the cell's life,
and it's kind of growing

125
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,042
and doing what it wants.

126
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,019
Actually, I'll make a
slight point here.

127
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,031
When I drew the DNA here, I
drew them as chromosomes.

128
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,013
But the reality is when we're
sitting in the interphase,

129
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:34,075
this is not what the DNA would
actually look like.

130
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:37,093
The DNA, if I were to actually
draw this, it's in its

131
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:40,057
chromatin form.

132
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:43,067
It's not all tightly wound
like I drew it here.

133
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,005
I drew it tightly wound so that
you can see that it got

134
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:51,092
replicated, but the reality is
that that green chromosome

135
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,098
would actually be all unwound,
and if you were looking in a

136
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:56,032
microscope, you would even
have trouble seeing it.

137
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:59,047
This is its chromatin form.

138
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:02,037
We'll talk a little bit about
where it actually organizes

139
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:06,005
itself back into a chromosome,
but in its chromatin form,

140
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:09,026
it's just a bunch of DNA and
proteins that the DNA is

141
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:11,061
wrapped around a little bit,
so you might have some

142
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,099
proteins here that the DNA is
wrapped around a little bit.

143
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,056
But if you're looking at it in
a microscope, it just looks

144
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:19,020
like a big blur of
DNA and proteins.

145
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,008
Same thing for the
magenta molecule.

146
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,000
Really, for DNA to
do anything, it

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,007
has to be like this.

148
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:29,014
It has to be open to its
environment in order for the

149
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:33,095
mRNA and the different types of
helper proteins to really

150
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:34,079
be able to function with it.

151
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,025
And even for it to be able to
replicate, it has to be

152
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:39,036
unwound like this in order
for it to function.

153
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,060
It only gets tightly wound
like this later on.

154
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,062
I just drew it like this, so
really it had one green one,

155
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:47,007
and it's going to replicate to
form another green one, and

156
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,000
they're going to be attached
at some point.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,025
That magenta one is going to
replicate to form another

158
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,043
magenta one, and they'll be
attached at some point, but

159
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:54,068
it's not going to be clear.

160
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:57,006
I just drew it this way to show
that it really happened.

161
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,031
This is the reality.

162
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:59,087
It's in its chromatin form.

163
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:03,006


164
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:06,093
Now, we're ready for mitosis.

165
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:09,006
So the first stage
of mitosis is

166
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:12,042
essentially-- let me draw this.

167
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:17,019
So I'll draw the
cell in green.

168
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,079
I'm going to draw the nucleus a
lot bigger than it normally

169
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,047
is relative to the cell just
because, at least right now, a

170
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,081
lot of the action is going
in the nucleus.

171
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:28,088
So the first stage of mitosis
is the prophase.

172
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:37,055


173
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:40,080
These are somewhat arbitrary
names that were assigned.

174
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,088
People looked in a microscope.

175
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:45,037
Oh, that's a certain type of
step that we always see when a

176
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:48,010
nucleus is dividing so we'll
call this the prophase.

177
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:55,021
What happens in the prophase is
that the actual chromatin

178
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:58,004
starts actually turning into
this type of form.

179
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:02,033
So as I just said, when we're
in the interphase, the DNA's

180
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,075
in this form where it's all
separated and unwound.

181
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:08,022
It actually starts to wind
together, so this is where

182
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,094
you'll actually have-- and
remember, it's already

183
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:10,048
replicated.

184
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:13,099
The replication happened
before mitosis begins.

185
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,084
So I had that one chromosome
there, and then I

186
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,039
have another one here.

187
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,074
It has two sister chromatids
that we'll see

188
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:24,026
soon get pulled apart.

189
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:30,000
Now, during prophase, you
also start to have these

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,005
centromeres appear that I
was touching on before.

191
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:40,037
These guys over here, they
start to facilitate the

192
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:44,005
generation of what you call
microtubules, and you can kind

193
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:46,076
of view these as these sticks or
these ropes that are going

194
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:50,088
to be key in moving things
around as we divide the cell.

195
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,015
All of this is pretty amazing.

196
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,062
I mean, you think of a cell, you
think of something that's

197
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:56,009
inherently pretty simple.

198
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:01,094
It's the most basic living
structure in us or in life.

199
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:05,075
But even here, you have these
complex mechanics going on,

200
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,036
and a lot of it still
isn't understood.

201
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:09,082
I mean, we can observe it, but
we really don't know what's

202
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:14,013
happening at the atomic level
or at the protein level that

203
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,072
allows these things to move
around in such a nicely

204
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:18,075
choreographed way.

205
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,048
It's still an area
of research.

206
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:23,051
Some of this is understood,
some of it isn't.

207
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:26,090
But you have these two
centrosomes, and they

208
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,097
facilitate the development of
these microtubules, which are

209
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,074
literally like these little
microstructures.

210
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:40,030
You can view them as tubes
or as some type of rope.

211
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,023
Now as prophase progresses, it
eventually gets to the point

212
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,072
where-- let me do it.

213
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,095
I don't want this word
replication written here.

214
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,002
It makes it confusing.

215
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:49,095
Let me delete that.

216
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,077
Let me get rid of this
replication.

217
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:54,046


218
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:58,069
So as prophase progresses, the
nuclear envelope actually

219
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,042
disappears.

220
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,043
So let me redraw this.

221
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,085
Let me copy and paste what
I've done before.

222
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:06,082


223
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,053
Put it there.

224
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:15,075
So as prophase progresses-- the
nuclear envelope actually

225
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:18,078
starts to disassemble.

226
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:24,039
So this starts to actually
dissolve and disassemble, and

227
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,033
then these things start to grow
and attach themselves to

228
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:29,084
the centromere.

229
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:31,028
So actually, let me do that.

230
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:34,023
So this is all during
prophase.

231
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:37,078


232
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,042
Since all of this happens during
prophase, this latter

233
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:43,038
part of prophase, sometimes
they'll call it late prophase,

234
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,082
sometimes it'll be called
prometaphase.

235
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:52,007


236
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,013
Sometimes it's considered-- I
don't think there's a hyphen

237
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,038
really there.

238
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,074


239
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:00,088
So sometimes it's actually
considered a separate phase of

240
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,070
mitosis, although when I learned
it in school, they

241
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,017
didn't bother with
prometaphase.

242
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,062
They just called it
all prophase.

243
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:09,062
But by the end of prophase,
or actually by the end of

244
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,022
prometaphase, depending on how
you want to view it, the whole

245
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:15,050
situation is going to look
something like this.

246
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,038
You have your overall cell.

247
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:20,046
The nuclear envelope has
disassembled, so to some

248
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:21,098
degree, it doesn't
exist anymore.

249
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:24,037
Although the proteins that
formed it are still there and

250
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,035
they're going to be
used later on.

251
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:29,084
And you have your two
chromosomes in this case.

252
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:32,079
In a human's case, you would
have 46 of them.

253
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,032
You have your two chomosomes,
each made with sister

254
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:41,004
chromatids, each made with
two sister chromatids.

255
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:42,019
Two chromosomes.

256
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,089
They, of course, have their
centromeres right there, and

257
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:55,015
then these centrosomes will
have migrated roughly on

258
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:59,092
opposite sides of what
was once the nucleus.

259
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:03,037
And these things have kind
of spread apart, these

260
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:06,074
microtubules, so they're doing
two functions, really.

261
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,026
At this point, they're
kind of pushing these

262
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:10,047
two centrosomes apart.

263
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,037
So you have all of these things,
and they're connecting

264
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,087
the-- you know, some of them
are coming from this

265
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,075
centrosome, some are coming from
this centrosome, some are

266
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,012
connecting the two.

267
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,089
And then some of these
microtubules, these tubes or

268
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:23,021
these ropes, however you want
to view them, attach

269
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:31,034
themselves to the centromeres of
the actual chromosomes, and

270
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:34,061
the protein structure that they
attach them to is called

271
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,057
the kinetochore.

272
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,015
So there's the kinetochore
there, and that may or may not

273
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:41,003
be-- kinetochore.

274
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,042
It's a protein structure.

275
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,094
It's actually fascinating.

276
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:46,098
It's still an open area of
research on how exactly the

277
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:49,035
microtubule attaches to the
kinetochore, and as we'll see

278
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:53,074
in a second, it's at the
kinetochore that the

279
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:58,039
microtubules essentially start
to pull at the two separate

280
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,066
sister chromatids and actually
pull them apart.

281
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,052
And it's actually
not understood

282
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,072
exactly how that works.

283
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:09,008
It's just been observed that
this actually happens.

284
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:14,001
Once prophase is done,
essentially the cells then

285
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,019
just make sure that the
chromosomes are well aligned.

286
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,026
I kind of drew them well aligned
here, but that just

287
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,075
kind of formally occurs
during metaphase,

288
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,009
which is the next phase.

289
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,003
The first one was prophase.

290
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:29,027
Now we're in metaphase, and
metaphase really is just an

291
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:32,067
aligning of the chromosomes, so
all of the chromosomes are

292
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:35,029
going to be aligned at the
center of the cell.

293
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:42,042
So I have my magenta one here,
I have my magenta one here,

294
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:45,065
and I have my other one here,
my green one there, and, of

295
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:49,096
course, you have your
centrosomes, the microspindles

296
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,057
that are coming off of them.

297
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,025
Some of them are kinetochore
microspindles that are

298
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:59,020
actually attaching to the
centromeres of the actual

299
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,047
chromosomes.

300
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:01,090
It's very confusing, right?

301
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,085
The centrosomes are these
structures that help direct

302
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:08,007
what happens to these
microtubules.

303
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,087
Centrioles are these little
structures, these little

304
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,085
can-shaped structures inside
the centrosomes, and the

305
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:19,004
centromere are the center
points where the two

306
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:22,016
chromatids attached to each
other within a chromosome.

307
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:25,085
So this is one sister chromatid,
that's another

308
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:28,025
sister chromatid, and they
attach at the centromere.

309
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,017
But this is metaphase.

310
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:33,010
It's fairly easy.

311
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,030
Metaphase, you just have this
aligning of the cells, and

312
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,022
there's actually some theories,
how does the cell

313
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,076
know to progress past
this point?

314
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,074
How does it know
that everything

315
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:42,024
is aligned and attached?

316
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,000
And then there are some theories
that there's actually

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,097
some signaling mechanism that
if one of these kinetochore

318
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:52,011
proteins isn't properly attached
to one of these

319
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:56,012
ropes, that somehow a signal
is sent that mitosis should

320
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:56,095
not continue.

321
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,020
So this is a very intricate
process.

322
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,053
You can imagine if you have 46
chromosomes and you have all

323
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:05,062
of this stuff going on in the
cell, and it's not like

324
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:08,008
there's some individual
pushing stuff, or some

325
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:08,079
computer here.

326
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,036
It's really directed
by chemistry and by

327
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,090
thermodynamic processes.

328
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:23,012
But just by the intricacy or
the elegance of how these

329
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:26,069
things are, it happens
spontaneously with all of the

330
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,077
proper checks and balances, so
that most of the time, nothing

331
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:32,021
bad happens, which is
all quite amazing.

332
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:36,026
So after metaphase, now we're
ready to pull the stuff apart,

333
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,051
and that's anaphase.

334
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:42,057


335
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:45,075
So in anaphase-- let
me write that down.

336
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:48,025
I've changed the color
of my cell.

337
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,027
These guys get pulled apart.

338
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:53,049
And as soon as they get pulled
apart-- so let's see, this

339
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,051
guy's getting pulled.

340
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:57,014
Let me do it in green.

341
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:00,053
So one of the sister-- nope,
that's not green.

342
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:03,040
One of the sister chromatids is
pulling in that direction.

343
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,066
One is getting pulled
in that direction.

344
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,051
And then the same is true
for the magenta ones.

345
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:10,000
Pulled in that direction,
and one is getting

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,077
pulled in that direction.

347
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:15,063
And, of course, you have your
centrosomes here and then

348
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:19,003
they're connected to the
kinetochores that are right

349
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,011
there and that's where
they're pulling.

350
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,089
There's also a whole microtubule
structure that

351
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,065
isn't connected to the actual
chromosomes, but they're

352
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:29,025
helping to actually push apart
these two centrosomes so that

353
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:32,056
everything is going to opposite
sides of the cell.

354
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:37,096
And so as soon as these two
chromatids are separated, and

355
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:40,014
I touched on this a little bit
before when we talked about

356
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:44,011
the vocabulary of DNA, then as
soon as that happens, these

357
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:47,002
are each referred to
as chromosomes.

358
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:49,096
So now you can say that
the cell has what it

359
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,075
used to have here.

360
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,076
It has two chromosomes.

361
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,090
It now has four chromosomes.

362
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,021
Because as soon as a chromatid
is no longer connected to its

363
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:59,058
sister chromatid, they're then
considered sister chromosomes,

364
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,009
which is just a naming
convention.

365
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,074
I mean, they were there before,
they were there after.

366
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:04,050
They were just attached
before.

367
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,039
Now they're not attached, so
you kind of consider them

368
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,093
their own individual entity.

369
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:10,058
And then we're almost done.

370
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:11,096
The last stage is telophase.

371
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:16,034


372
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm going to draw the cell a
little bit different here

373
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,065
because something is happening
simultaneously with telophase

374
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:24,072
most of the time.

375
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,091
So telophase, and actually I'll

376
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:28,051
rotate the cell 90 degrees.

377
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:30,079
Let's say that this was
one centromere.

378
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,093
This is the other centromere.

379
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:34,064
So at this point,
it's essentially

380
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:37,067
pulled the DNA to itself.

381
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:43,000
So this guy has pulled one copy
of that chromosome and

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,013
one copy of this chromosome.

383
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,073
That guy's done the
same up here.

384
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:50,036
He's pulled over one copy of
each-- oh, I used a different

385
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:54,005
color-- one copy of each
chromosome to himself.

386
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,019
Let me draw that right
there like that.

387
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,020
And now the nuclear membranes
start forming around each of

388
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,098
these two ends.

389
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,066
So now you start having a
nuclear membrane form around

390
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,075
each of these two ends.

391
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:09,030
And so by the end of the
telophase-- that's what we're

392
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,088
in, the telophase-- we will
have completed mitosis.

393
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:17,010
We will have completely
replicated our two original

394
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,029
nucleuses and all of the genetic
content inside of it.

395
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,043
Now, at the same time telophase
is happening, you

396
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:27,044
also normally have this
cytokinesis, where this

397
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:31,025
cleavage furrow forms, where
essentially-- during

398
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:33,056
telophase, these things are
getting pushed further and

399
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:37,072
further apart by those
microtubules so that they're

400
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:42,016
already at the ends of the cell,
of the cytoplasm of the

401
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,026
cell, and you can almost view
them as pushing on the sides

402
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,085
to elongate the cell.

403
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,044
As that is happening, you have
this furrow forming, this

404
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:51,030
little indentation.

405
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,051
By the end of telophase in
mitosis, you also have this

406
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:58,033
process of cytokinesis, where
this cleavage furrow forms and

407
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:01,090
deepens, deepens, deepens
until the cytoplasm is

408
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,073
actually split into two
separate cells.

409
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:08,055
So this is cytokinesis, which
is formally not a part of

410
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:13,045
mitosis, but it normally occurs
with the telophase, so

411
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,095
right at the end of mitosis,
you do normally have two

412
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,076
complete identical cells.

413
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:22,079
Once you have each of these
two cells, then they, each

414
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,014
individually, enter their
own interphase.

415
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,083
Or they each individually, if
we look at just this one, he

416
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,077
will then be in his G1 phase.

417
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:34,065
At some point, these two things
are going to replicate,

418
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,050
and that's the S phase, and you
go to the G2 phase, and

419
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,027
then this guy will experience
mitosis all over again.

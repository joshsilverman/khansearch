1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,075


2
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:04,048
We know from the last video that
if we have a high calcium

3
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:09,003
ion concentration inside of the
muscle cell, those calcium

4
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:13,050
ions will bond to the troponin
proteins which will then

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,014
change their shape in such a way
that the tropomyosin will

6
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:20,057
be moved out of the way and so
then the myosin heads can

7
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:23,030
crawl along the actin filaments
and them we'll

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,094
actually have muscle
contractions.

9
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:29,014
So high calcium concentration,
or calcium ion concentration,

10
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:30,085
we have contraction.

11
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:35,056
Low calcium ion concentration,
these troponin proteins go to

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:39,006
their standard confirmation and
they pull-- or you can say

13
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,060
they move the tropomyosin back
in the way of the myosin

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,016
heads-- and we have
no contraction.

15
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:53,075


16
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:57,014
So the next obvious question
is, how does the muscle

17
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,085
regulate whether we have high
calcium concentration and

18
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:03,035
contraction or low calcium
concentration and relaxation?

19
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:04,093
Or even a better question
is, how does the

20
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,082
nervous system do it?

21
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:09,048
How does the nervous system tell
the muscle to contract,

22
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,054
to make its calcium
concentration high and

23
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:14,001
contract or to make it
low again and relax?

24
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,090
And to understand that, let's
do a little bit a review of

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,079
what we learned on the
videos on neurons.

26
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me draw the terminal
junction of

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,050
an axon right here.

28
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,054
Instead of having a synapse
with a dendrite of another

29
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,089
neuron, it's going to have
a synapse with an

30
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:35,012
actual muscle cell.

31
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,014
So this is its synapse with
the actual muscle cell.

32
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:44,042


33
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,017
This is a synapse with an
actual muscle cell.

34
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:50,006
Let me label everything just
so you don't get confused.

35
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,046
This is the axon.

36
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,046
We could call it the terminal
end of an axon.

37
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,060


38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,085
This is the synapse.

39
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:05,043


40
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:08,015
Just a little terminology from
the neuron videos-- this space

41
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,021
was a synaptic cleft.

42
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:13,065
This is the presynaptic
neuron.

43
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:15,043
This is-- I guess you could
kind of view it-- the

44
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:16,083
post-synaptic cell.

45
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,005
It's not a neuron
in this case.

46
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,009
And then just so we
have-- this is our

47
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:30,024
membrane of muscle cell.

48
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,053
And I'm going to do-- probably
the next video or maybe a

49
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,053
video after that, I'll actually
show you the anatomy

50
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,061
of a muscle cell.

51
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,022
In this, it'll be a little
abstract because we really

52
00:02:37,022 --> 00:02:39,030
want to understand how
the calcium ion

53
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,081
concentration is regulated.

54
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,006
This is called a sarcolemma.

55
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:53,058


56
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:56,012
So this is the membrane
of the muscle cell.

57
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:59,006
And this right here-- you could
imagine it's just a fold

58
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,097
into the membrane of
the muscle cell.

59
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,000
If I were to look at the surface
of the muscle cell,

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,084
then it would look like a little
bit of a hole or an

61
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,003
indentation that goes into the
cell, but here we did a cross

62
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:14,000
section so you can imagine it
folding in, but if you poked

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,059
it in with a needle or
something, this is

64
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,024
what you would get.

65
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,009
You would get a fold
in the membrane.

66
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,046
And this right here is
called a T-tubule.

67
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:26,036


68
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:28,009
And the T just stands
for transverse.

69
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:31,071
It's going transverse to the
surface of the membrane.

70
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:35,006
And over here-- and this is the
really important thing in

71
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,056
this video, or the
really important

72
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:37,052
organelle in this video.

73
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:42,040
You have this organelle inside
of the muscle cell called the

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,088
sarcoplasmic reticulum.

75
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:54,074


76
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:57,069
And it actually is very similar
to an endoplasmic

77
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:03,018
reticulum in somewhat of what
it is or maybe how it's

78
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:06,075
related to an endoplasmic
reiticulum-- but here its main

79
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,075
function is storage.

80
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:10,040
While an endoplasmic reticulum,
it's involved in

81
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,046
protein development and it has
ribosomes attached to it, but

82
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,086
this is purely a storage
organelle.

83
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:22,050
What the sarcoplasmic reticulum
does it has calcium

84
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:32,092
ion pumps on its membrane and
what these do is they're ATP

85
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:37,052
aces, which means that they
use ATP to fuel the pump.

86
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:42,044
So you have ATP come in, ATP
attaches to it, and maybe a

87
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:52,062
calcium ion will attach to it,
and when the ATP hydrolyzes

88
00:04:52,062 --> 00:05:01,047
into ADP plus a phosphate
group, that changes the

89
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,013
confirmation of this protein
and it pumps

90
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,069
the calcium ion in.

91
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:08,023
So the calcium ions
get pumped in.

92
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:12,061
So the net effect of all of
these calcium ion pumps on the

93
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:16,054
membrane of the sarcoplasmic
reticulum is in a resting

94
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:20,069
muscle, we'll have a very high
concentration of calcium ions

95
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,094
on the inside.

96
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:26,062


97
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,056
Now, I think you could
probably guess

98
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,098
where this is going.

99
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:33,000
When the muscle needs to
contract, these calcium ions

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,031
get dumped out into the
cytoplasm of the cell.

101
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:42,061
And then they're able to bond
to the troponin right here,

102
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:45,012
and do everything we talked
about in the last video.

103
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,018
So what we care about is, just
how does it know when to dump

104
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:51,075
its calcium ions into the
rest of the cell?

105
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:53,013
This is the inside
of the cell.

106
00:05:53,013 --> 00:06:00,037


107
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:06,036
And so this area is what the
actin filaments and the myosin

108
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:09,035
heads and all of the rest,
and the troponin, and the

109
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,023
tropomyosin-- they're all
exposed to the environment

110
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,031
that is over here.

111
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:15,027
So you can imagine-- I could
just draw it here

112
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,052
just to make it clear.

113
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:21,048


114
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,068
I'm drawing it very abstract.

115
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,048
We'll see more of the structure
in a future video.

116
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:38,064


117
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,087
This is a very abstract drawing,
but I think this'll

118
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,064
give you a sense of
what's going on.

119
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:45,050
So let's say this neuron-- and
we'll call this a motor

120
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:54,037
neuron-- it's signaling for
a muscle contraction.

121
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:57,061
So first of all, we know how
signals travel across neurons,

122
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:01,010
especially across axons with
an action potential.

123
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,045
We could have a sodium
channel right here.

124
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:07,041
It's voltage gated so you have
a little bit of a positive

125
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,050
voltage there.

126
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,042
That tells this voltage gated
sodium channel to open up.

127
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:16,016
So it opens up and allows even
more of the sodium to flow in.

128
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,033
That makes it a little bit
more positive here.

129
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:21,087
So then that triggers the next
voltage gated channel to open

130
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,000
up-- and so it keeps traveling
down the membrane of the

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,041
axon-- and eventually, when you
get enough of a positive

132
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,058
threshold, voltage gated calcium
channels open up.

133
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:36,006


134
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,068
This is all a review
of what we learned

135
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:39,074
in the neuron videos.

136
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,075
So eventually, when it gets
positive enough close to these

137
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:44,029
calcium ion channels, they
allow the calcium

138
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,030
ions to flow in.

139
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,006
And the calcium ions flow in and
they bond to those special

140
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:53,094
proteins near the synaptic
membrane or the presynaptic

141
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,085
membrane right there.

142
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:56,000
These are calcium ions.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,099
They bond to proteins that
were docking vesicles.

144
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:08,017
Remember, vesicles were just
these membranes around

145
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,042
neurotransmitters.

146
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:13,025


147
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:17,050
When the calcium binds to those
proteins, it allows

148
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,083
exocytosis to occur.

149
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,085
It allows the membrane of the
vesicles to merge with the

150
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,018
membrane of the actual
neuron and the

151
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,060
contents get dumped out.

152
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,067
This is all review from
the neuron videos.

153
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:31,047
I explained it in much more
detail in those videos, but

154
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,049
you have-- all of these

155
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,050
neurotransmitters get dumped out.

156
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,080
And we were talking about the
synapse between a neuron and a

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,045
muscle cell.

158
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,005
The neurotransmitter
here is acitocolin.

159
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:47,012


160
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:49,032
But just like what would happen
at a dendrite, the

161
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:53,099
acetylcholine binds to receptors
on the sarcolemma or

162
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:57,040
the membrane of the muscle cell
and that opens sodium

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,082
channels on the muscle cell.

164
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:02,033
So the muscle cell also has a a
voltage gradient across its

165
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:07,021
membrane, just like
a neuron does.

166
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:11,014
So when this guy gets some
acetylcholene, it allows

167
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:16,024
sodium to flow inside
the muscle cell.

168
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:18,058
So you have a plus there and
that causes an action

169
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,099
potential in the muscle cell.

170
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:22,050
So then you have a little bit
of a positive charge.

171
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,067
If it gets high enough to a
threshold level, it'll trigger

172
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,010
this voltage gated channel right
here, which will allow

173
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,037
more sodium to flow in.

174
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,008
So it'll become a little
bit positive over here.

175
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,003
Of course, it also has potassium
to reverse it.

176
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,087
It's just like what's going
on in a neuron.

177
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:41,097
So eventually this action
potential-- you have a sodium

178
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,016
channel over here.

179
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,077
It gets a little bit positive.

180
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:47,071
When it gets enough positive,
then it opens up and allows

181
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:49,075
even more sodium to flow in.

182
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:51,025
So you have this action
potential.

183
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,023
and then that action potential--
so you have a

184
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:57,095
sodium channel over here-- it
goes down this T-tubule.

185
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,023
So the information from the
neuron-- you could imagine the

186
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:03,092
action potential then turns into
kind of a chemical signal

187
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:06,037
which triggers another
action potential that

188
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,087
goes down the T-tubule.

189
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:10,055
And this is the interesting
part-- and actually this is an

190
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:13,066
area of open research right
now and I'll give you some

191
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:17,086
leads if you want to read more
about this research-- is that

192
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:20,094
you have a protein complex that
essentially bridges the

193
00:10:20,094 --> 00:10:23,000
sarcoplasmic reticulum
to the T-tubule.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,060
And I'll just draw it as
a big box right here.

195
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,017
So you have this protein
complex right there.

196
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:34,097
And I'll actually show it--
people believe-- I'll sort

197
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:36,026
some words out here.

198
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:44,016
It involves the proteins
triodin, junctin,

199
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:51,017
calsequestran, and rianodine.

200
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:56,028


201
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:59,054
But they're somehow involved in
a protein complex here that

202
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:04,054
bridges between the T-tubule the
sarcoplasmic verticulum,

203
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,072
but the big picture is what
happens when this action

204
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:09,087
potential travels down here--
so we get positive enough

205
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:16,027
right around here, this complex
of proteins triggers

206
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,061
the release of calcium.

207
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:20,091
And they think that the
ryanodine is actually the part

208
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:23,092
that actually releases the
calcium, but we could just say

209
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:27,078
that it-- maybe it's triggered
right here.

210
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,033
When the action potential
travels down-- let me switch

211
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,000
to another color.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,010
I'm using this purple
too much.

213
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,098
When the action potential gets
far enough-- I'll use red

214
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:40,007
right here-- when the action
potential gets far enough-- so

215
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,025
this environment gets a little
positive with all those sodium

216
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:45,091
ions flowing in, this mystery
box-- and you could do web

217
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,010
searches for these proteins.

218
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,002
People are still trying to
understand exactly how this

219
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:52,057
mystery box works-- it triggers
an opening for all of

220
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:57,028
these calcium ions to escape
the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

221
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:03,087
So then all these calcium ions
get dumped into the outside of

222
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:07,061
the sarcoplasmic reticulum
into-- just the inside of the

223
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:10,023
cell, into the cytoplasm
of the cell.

224
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,054
Now when that happens, what's
doing to happen?

225
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:14,066
Well, the high calcium
concentration, the calcium

226
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,038
ions bond to the troponin, just
like what we said at the

227
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:18,075
beginning of the video.

228
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:23,038
The calcium ions bond to the
troponin, move the tropomyosin

229
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:26,051
out of the way, and then the
myosin using ATP like we

230
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:30,004
learned two videos ago can start
crawling up the actin--

231
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:35,002
and at the same time, once the
signal disappears, this thing

232
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:39,028
shuts down and then these
calcium ion pumps will reduce

233
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:41,017
the calcium ion concentration
again.

234
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:45,007
And then our contraction will
stop and the muscle will get

235
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,009
relaxed again.

236
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:49,007
So the whole big thing here is
that we have this container of

237
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:52,044
calcium ions that, when the
muscles relax, is essentially

238
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:55,033
taking the calcium ions out of
the inside of the cell so the

239
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:58,083
muscle is relaxed so that you
can't have your myosin climb

240
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,033
up the actin.

241
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:03,019
But then when it gets the
signal, it dumps it back in

242
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,003
and then we actually have a
muscle contraction because the

243
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:11,027
tropomyosin gets moved out of
the way by the troponin., So I

244
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:11,042
don't know.

245
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,009
That's pretty fascinating.

246
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,015
It's actually even fascinating
that this is still not

247
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:16,020
completely well understood.

248
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,013
This is an active-- if you want
to become a biological

249
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:21,036
researcher, this could be an
interesting thing to try to

250
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,033
understand.

251
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,074
One, it's interesting just from
a scientific point of

252
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,089
view of how this actually
functions, but there's

253
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,062
actually-- there's maybe
potential diseases that are

254
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:34,021
byproducts of malfunctioning
proteins right here.

255
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,004
Maybe you can somehow make these
things perform better or

256
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:37,076
worse, or who knows.

257
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:41,096
So there actually are positive
impacts that you could have if

258
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:44,075
you actually figured out what
exactly is going on here when

259
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:47,044
the action potential
shows up to open up

260
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:48,049
this calcium channel.

261
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:49,076
So now we have the
big picture.

262
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:53,076
We know how a motor neuron can
stimulate a contraction of a

263
00:13:53,076 --> 00:14:00,024
cell by allowing the
sarcoplasmic reticulum to

264
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:03,049
allow calcium ions to travel
across this membrane in the

265
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,059
cytoplasm of the cell.

266
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:07,024
And I was doing a little bit of
reading before this video.

267
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:08,074
These pumps are very
efficient.

268
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:11,098
So once the signal goes away and
this door is closed right

269
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:16,089
here, this this sarcoplasmic
reticulum can get back the ion

270
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,007
concentration in about
30 milliseconds.

271
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:22,010
So that's why we're so good at
stopping contractions, why I

272
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,082
can punch and then pull back my
arm and then have it relax

273
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:28,087
all within split-seconds
because we can stop the

274
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:33,051
contraction in 30 milliseconds,
which is less

275
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,066
than 1/30 of a second.

276
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,050
So anyway, I'll see in the next
video, where we'll study

277
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,002
the actual anatomy of
a muscle cell in a

278
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,084
little bit more detail.

279
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:41,094

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,057


2
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:03,035
In the last video, I showed you
what a neuron looked like

3
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:05,079
and we talked about the
different parts of a neuron,

4
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:08,048
and I gave you the general
idea what a neuron does.

5
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,026
It gets stimulated at the
dendrites-- and the

6
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:13,073
stimulation we'll talk about
in future videos on what

7
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:16,048
exactly that means-- and
that that impulse, that

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,044
information, that signal
gets added up.

9
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:22,048
If there's multiple stimulation
points on various

10
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:25,066
dendrites, it gets added up and
if it meets some threshold

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,030
level, it's going to create
this action potential or

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:34,038
signal that travels across the
axon and maybe stimulates

13
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:38,054
other neurons or muscles because
these terminal points

14
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:41,028
of the axons might be connected
to dendrites of

15
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:44,054
other neurons or to muscle
cells or who knows what.

16
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:46,068
But what I want to do in this
video is kind of lay the

17
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:50,010
building blocks for exactly
what this signal is or how

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,035
does a neuron actually transmit
this information

19
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,097
across the axon-- or really,
how does it go from the

20
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:59,063
dendrite all the way
to the axon?

21
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:01,096
Before I actually even talk
about that, we need to kind of

22
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:07,040
lay the ground rules-- or a
ground understanding of the

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,012
actual voltage potential
across the

24
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:11,006
membrane of a neuron.

25
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,006
And, actually, all cells have
some voltage potential

26
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:15,065
difference, but it's especially
relevant when we

27
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:18,010
talk about a neuron and its
ability to send signals.

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,074
Let's zoom in on a
neuron's cell.

29
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:25,057


30
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:27,087
I could zoom in on any point
on this cell that's not

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,040
covered by a myelin sheath.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,051
I'm going to zoom in
on its membrane.

33
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:39,046
So let's say that this is
the membrane of the

34
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:43,026
neuron, just like that.

35
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,006
That's the membrane.

36
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:50,096
This is outside the neuron
or the cell.

37
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:56,073
And then this is inside the
neuron or the cell.

38
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:59,021
Now, you have sodium
and potassium

39
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:00,037
ions floating around.

40
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,092
I'm going to draw sodium
like this.

41
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:03,090
Sodium's going to be a circle.

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,076
So that's sodium and their
positively charged ions have a

43
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:09,084
plus one charge and then
potassium, I'll draw them as

44
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:11,034
little triangles.

45
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,015
So let's say that's potassium--
symbol for

46
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,031
potassium is K.

47
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,018
It's also positively charged.

48
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,071
And you have them just
lying around.

49
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,034
Let's say we start off
both inside and

50
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,022
outside of the cell.

51
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:38,055


52
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:40,090
They're all positively
charged.

53
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,080
Sodium inside, some
sodium outside.

54
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,000
Now it turns out that cells
have more positive charge

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,012
outside of their membranes than

56
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,040
inside of their membranes.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,083
So there's actually a potential
difference that if

58
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,044
the membrane wasn't there,
negative charges would want to

59
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:59,037
escape or positive charges
or positive ions

60
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:01,012
would want to get in.

61
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:03,062
The outside ends up being more
positive, and we're going to

62
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:04,087
talk about why.

63
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:10,013


64
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:14,047
So this is an electrical
potential gradient, right?

65
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:18,030
If this is less positive than
that-- if I have a positive

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,078
charge here, it's going to
want to go to the less

67
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:20,053
positive side.

68
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,081
It's going to want to
go away from the

69
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,087
other positive charges.

70
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:25,031
It's repelled by the other
positive charges.

71
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,061
Likewise, if I had a negative
charge here, it'd want to go

72
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:30,028
the other side-- or a positive
charge, I guess, would be

73
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:32,053
happier being here
than over here.

74
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:34,015
But the question is, how
does that happen?

75
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,056
Because left to their own
devices, the charges would

76
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,084
disperse so you wouldn't have
this potential gradient.

77
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,090
Somehow we have to put energy
into the system in order to

78
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,086
produce this state where we
have more positive on the

79
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:49,006
charge of the outside than
we do on the inside.

80
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:52,053
And that's done by sodium
potassium pumps.

81
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:55,056
I'm going to draw then
a certain way.

82
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,081
This is obviously not how the
protein actually looks, but

83
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:00,087
it'll give you a sense of how it
actually pumps things out.

84
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:03,069


85
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,022
I'll draw that side
of the protein.

86
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:08,075
Maybe it looks like this and
you'll have a sense of why I

87
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,005
drew it like this.

88
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:14,000
So that side of the protein or
the enzyme-- and then the

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,063
other side, I'll draw
it like this.

90
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:18,037
It looks something like this,
and of course the real protein

91
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,025
doesn't look like this.

92
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,050
You've seen me show you what
proteins really look like.

93
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,062
They look like big clusters
of things, hugely complex.

94
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:27,056
Different parts of the proteins
can bond to different

95
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:31,014
things and when things bond to
proteins, they change shape.

96
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,056
But I'm doing a very simple
diagram here and what I want

97
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:37,017
to show you is, this is our
sodium potassium pump in its

98
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,057
inactivated state.

99
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,068
And what happens in this
situation is that we have

100
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:44,029
these nice places where our
sodium can bind to.

101
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:49,093
So in this situation, sodium can
bind to these locations on

102
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:52,031
our enzyme or on our protein.

103
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,047
And if we just had the sodiums
bind and we didn't have any

104
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,006
energy going into the system,
nothing would happen.

105
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,026
It would just stay in
this situation.

106
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:01,064
The actual protein might look
like something crazy.

107
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:05,029
The actual protein might be this
big cloud of protein and

108
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,019
then your sodiums bond there,
there, and there.

109
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:11,093
Maybe it's inside the protein
somehow, but still, nothing's

110
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:15,050
going to happen just when the
sodium bonds on this side of

111
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,067
the protein.

112
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,073
In order for it to do anything,
in order for it to

113
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:24,049
pump anything out, it uses
the energy from ATP.

114
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:27,057
So we had all those videos on
respiration and I told you

115
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:30,052
that ATP was the currency of
energy in the cell-- well,

116
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,002
this is something useful
for ATP to do.

117
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:38,027
ATP-- that's adenosine
triphosphate-- it might go to

118
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:42,016
some other part of our enzyme,
but in this diagram maybe it

119
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,022
goes to this part
of the enzyme.

120
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:47,017


121
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:50,038
And this enzyme, it's
a type of ATPase.

122
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,075
When I say ATPase, it breaks off
a phosphate from the ATP--

123
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:56,041
and that's just by virtue
of its shape.

124
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,091
It's able to plunk it off.

125
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:01,026
When it plunks off the
phosphate, it changes shape.

126
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:06,031


127
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:11,050
So step one, we have sodium
ions-- and actually, let's

128
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,006
keep count of them.

129
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,031
We have three sodium-- these are
the actual ratios-- three

130
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:23,056
sodium ions from inside the
cell or the neuron.

131
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:29,032
They bond to pump, which is
really a protein that crosses

132
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,092
our membrane.

133
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:34,058
Now, step two, we
have also ATP.

134
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:41,004
ATP gets broken into ATP plus
phosphate on the actual

135
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:43,035
protein and that changes
the shape.

136
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:51,063
So that also provides energy
to change pump's shape.

137
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:55,077


138
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,043
Now this is when the
pump was before.

139
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:01,092
Now after, our pump might look
something like this.

140
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,056
Let me clear out some
space right here.

141
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,019
I'll draw the after
pump right there.

142
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,086


143
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:09,039
And so this is before.

144
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,045
After the phosphate gets split
off of the ATP, it might look

145
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:14,082
something like this.

146
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:18,036
Instead of being in that
configuration, it opens in the

147
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,012
other direction.

148
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:21,042
So now it might look something
like this.

149
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:24,017


150
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:27,050
And of course it's carrying
these phosphate groups.

151
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,077
They have a positive charge.

152
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:31,047


153
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:32,031
It's open like this.

154
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:36,038
This side now looks like this.

155
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,093
So now the phosphates are
released to the outside.

156
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,030
So they've been pumped
to the outside.

157
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,018
Remember, this is required
energy because it's going

158
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:43,087
against the natural gradient.

159
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,029
You're taking positive charge
and you're pushing them to an

160
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,067
environment that is even more
positive and you're also

161
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,074
taking it to an environment
where there's already a lot of

162
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:55,062
sodium, and you're putting
more sodium there.

163
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:58,037
So you're going against the
charge gradient and you're

164
00:07:58,037 --> 00:07:59,098
going against the
sodium gradient.

165
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,055
But now-- I guess we call it
step three-- the sodium gets

166
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:07,008
released outside the cell.

167
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:10,035
And when this changes shape,
it's not so good at bonding

168
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,049
with the sodium anymore.

169
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:13,066
So maybe these can become a
little bit different too, so

170
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:16,041
that the sodium can't even bond
in this configuration now

171
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:20,007
that the protein has changed
shape due to the ATP.

172
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:26,011
So step three, the three Na
plusses, sodium ions-- are

173
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,058
released outside.

174
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:31,069


175
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,075
Now once it's in this
configuration, we have all

176
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,082
these positive ions out here.

177
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,048
These positive ions want to get
really as far away from

178
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,024
each other as possible.

179
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:42,032
They'd actually probably be
attracted to the cell itself

180
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:44,082
because the cell is less
positive on the inside.

181
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:48,059
So these positive ions-- and in
particular, the potassium--

182
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,016
can bond this side of the
protein when it's in this-- I

183
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:55,054
guess we could call it this
activated configuration.

184
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:58,057
So now, I guess we could
call it step four.

185
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:01,039


186
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:07,025
We have two sodium ions bond
to-- I guess we could call it

187
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:12,067
the activated pump--
or changed pump.

188
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:15,032
Or maybe we could say it's
in its open form.

189
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:18,092
So they come here and when they
bond, it re-changes the

190
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:24,042
shape of this protein back
to this shape, back

191
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,059
to that open shape.

192
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,065
Now when it goes back to the
open shape, these guys aren't

193
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:30,050
here anymore, but we have these
two guys sitting here

194
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,092
and in this shape right here,
all of a sudden these divots--

195
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,065
maybe they're not divots.

196
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:37,086
They're actually things in this
big cluster of protein.

197
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:42,023
They're not as good at staying
bonded or holding onto these

198
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:47,028
sodiums so these sodiums get
released into the cell.

199
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:53,030
So step five, the pump-- this
changes shape of pump.

200
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,063
So pump changes shape
to original.

201
00:09:56,063 --> 00:10:05,020


202
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,022
And then once we're in the
original, those two sodium

203
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:15,091
ions released inside the cell.

204
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,099
We're going to see in the next
few videos why it's useful to

205
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:19,069
have those sodium ions
on the inside.

206
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,036
You might say, well, why don't
we just keep pumping things on

207
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,041
the outside in order to have
a potential difference?

208
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,050
But we'll see these
sodium ions are

209
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,062
actually also very useful.

210
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,087
So what's the net effect
that's going on?

211
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:35,092
We end up with a lot more sodium
ions on the outside and

212
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:40,041
we end up with more potassium
ions on the inside, but I told

213
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,094
you that the inside is less
positive than the outside.

214
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,029
But these are both positive.

215
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,085
I don't care if I have more
potassium or sodium, but if

216
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:50,075
you paid attention to the ratios
I talked about, every

217
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:54,028
time we use an ATP, we're
pumping out three sodiums and

218
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,086
we're only pumping in two
potassiums, right?

219
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:02,087
We pumped out three sodiums and
two potassiums. Each of

220
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:06,061
them have a plus-1 charge, but
every time we do this, we're

221
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,096
adding a net-1 charge to
the outside, right?

222
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,090
3 on the outside,
2 to the inside.

223
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,055
We have a net-1 charge-- we have
a plus-1 to the outside.

224
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:17,076
So we're making the outside
more positive, especially

225
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,051
relative to the inside.

226
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,084
And this is what creates that
potential difference.

227
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:24,000
If you actually took a
voltmeter-- a voltmeter

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,076
measures electrical potential
difference-- and you took the

229
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:31,079
voltage difference between that
point and this point-- or

230
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,044
more specifically, between this
point and that point, if

231
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:37,030
you were to subtract the voltage
here from the voltage

232
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:43,071
there, you will get -70
millivolts, which is generally

233
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:46,064
considered the resting voltage
difference, the potential

234
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:49,090
difference across the membrane
of a neuron when it's in its

235
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,000
resting state.

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,017
So in this video, I kind of laid
out the foundation of why

237
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:59,019
and how a cell using ATP,
using energy, is able to

238
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,028
maintain a potential difference
across its membrane

239
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:06,049
where the outside is slightly
more positive than the inside.

240
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,053
So we actually have a negative
potential difference if we're

241
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,080
comparing the inside
to the outside.

242
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,025
Positive charge would want to
move in if they were allowed

243
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,087
to, and negative charge would
want to move out if it was

244
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,002
allowed to.

245
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,067
Now there might be one
last question.

246
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:23,037
You might say, well, if we just
kept adding charge out

247
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:25,092
here, our voltage difference
would get really negative.

248
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:29,028
This would be much more negative
than the outside.

249
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:32,002
Why does it stabilize at -70?

250
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,024
To answer that question-- these
are going to come into

251
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:37,054
play in a lot more detail in
future videos-- you also have

252
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:42,052
channels, which are really
protein structures that in

253
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:46,074
their open position will allow
sodium to go through them.

254
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:48,054
And there are also channels
that are in their open

255
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:51,012
position, would allow potassium
to go through them.

256
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:53,001
I'm drawing it in their
closed position.

257
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,088
And we're going to talk in the
next video about what happens

258
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,094
when they open.

259
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:57,070
But in their closed position,
they're still

260
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,095
a little bit leaky.

261
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:03,052


262
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:06,055
And if, say, the concentration
of potassium becomes too high

263
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:11,052
down here-- and too high meaning
when they start to

264
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:14,055
reach this threshold of -70
millivolts-- or even better,

265
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,082
when the sodium gets too high
out there, a few of them will

266
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,067
start to leak down.

267
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,005
When the concentration gets
really high and this is really

268
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:22,055
positive just because of the
electrical potential, some of

269
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:23,099
them will just be
shoved through.

270
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:26,092
So it'll keep us right around
-70 millivolts.

271
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:29,078
And if we go below, maybe some
of the potassium gets leaked

272
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,058
through the other way.

273
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:33,024
So even though when these are
shut-- if it becomes too

274
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:37,014
ridiculous-- if it goes to -80
millivolts or -90 millivolts,

275
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:39,040
all of a sudden, there'd be a
huge incentive for some of

276
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,070
this stuff to leak through their
respective channels.

277
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,040
So that's what allows
us to stay at that

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,054
stable voltage potential.

279
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:48,050
In the next video, we're going
to see what happens to this

280
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,039
voltage potential when the
neuron is actually stimulated.

281
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,063

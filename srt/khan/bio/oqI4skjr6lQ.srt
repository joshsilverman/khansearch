1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,050


2
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,052
When we learned about antigen
presenting cells, we learned

3
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:06,012
that they can first digest
something-- let me draw a

4
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:09,069
dendritic cell right here--
my best version

5
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:11,044
of a dendritic cell.

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,011
Maybe I should draw them
simpler than that.

7
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:16,098
A dendritic cell is a phagocyte
and it is an antigen

8
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:17,085
presenting cell.

9
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:22,062
So after phagocytoses some type
of a pathogen, it'll cut

10
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:26,055
it all up, and then it'll
display-- it'll present the

11
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:35,099
antigen on its surface on a
protein complex here and the

12
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:38,038
part of the pathogen that
it cut up, it'll

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,003
put up right here.

14
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,000
And we learned on the antigen
presenting cell video that

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,057
this complex right here was an
MHC type II complex, where MHC

16
00:00:49,057 --> 00:01:02,075
stands for major
histocompatibility complex.

17
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:06,079
Where histocompatibility just
means tissue compatibility.

18
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,098
And this was the case on antigen
presenting cells.

19
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:10,054
So even B cells did this.

20
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,039
Let me draw a B cell.

21
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,090
So a B cell-- it has
its membrane bound

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,076
antibody, just like that.

23
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:23,021
It actually has many, many
thousands of these.

24
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,012
I could keep drawing a bunch of
them, but just so you know

25
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,070
there's more than one.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,056
Maybe one of these get triggered
or get attached to

27
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:36,073
some type of virus or protein
or bacteria floating around.

28
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:41,034
And what it'll do is it'll take
this in and cut it up

29
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:45,076
again and do the same thing as
what the dendritic cell did.

30
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:56,062
It'll cut up a part of this and
present it on its surface

31
00:01:56,062 --> 00:02:01,017
in conjunction with
an MHC II complex.

32
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:05,031
So once again, this is
an MHC II complex.

33
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:09,068
So these professional antigen
presenting cells that go out

34
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,046
and take things out of the
fluid, out of the humoral

35
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:17,018
parts of our body, things
just floating around.

36
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:19,086
They'll take them in, they'll
say, this is bad, cut them up,

37
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,077
and then present them
on these MHC II.

38
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:24,000
That's why we call them
professional antigen

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,047
presenting cells.

40
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:35,053
Now, it turns out that pretty
much all cells in our bodies--

41
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,006
when I say almost all
cells, it's actually

42
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,047
all nucleated cells.

43
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:44,018
So all cells that have a nucleus
in the human body-- so

44
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:46,037
the only cells in our human body
that don't have nucleuses

45
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,059
are red blood cells, which I
find fascinating-- so that

46
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:51,031
they can have more space
for storing hemoglobin.

47
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:56,003
But all nucleated cells in our
bodies have another major

48
00:02:56,003 --> 00:03:05,065
histocompatibility complex on it
and it's called an MHC I--

49
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:08,053
major histocompatibility
type I.

50
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:10,077
And just so you know, these
are also nucleated cells.

51
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:16,000
So they're also going to have an
MHC type I complex on them

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,024
right here.

53
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:21,003
Now the interesting thing about
the MHC type I complex

54
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:30,094
is because it's on every cell in
our human body-- so pretty

55
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:36,000
much everything but the red
blood cells have an MHC I--

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,087
this is where if anything
wacky is going

57
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,090
on inside the cell.

58
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,025
Maybe the cell is cancerous and
producing crazy proteins.

59
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,012
Maybe it's been infected
with a virus.

60
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:48,043
Maybe some type of bacteria or
some type of weird protein has

61
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:52,008
gotten in here-- any cell in the
human body can cut those

62
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,046
up, even if it's malfunctioning,
and it will

63
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,009
present them.

64
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,093
So let's say the cell
is cancerous.

65
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:59,034
So this cell's cancerous and
it has all these wacky

66
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:02,013
proteins that only cancer cells
present that is not

67
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:04,074
normal for a normal cell--
that will be

68
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:07,013
presented on the MHC I.

69
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:13,021
Let's say that I have some other
cell in my body that's a

70
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,009
different type of cell.

71
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,037
It's nucleated.

72
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:18,086
Let's say it's been infected
with a virus.

73
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:23,038
So it's turning into
this virus factory.

74
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:25,098
Same thing-- there are
mechanisms in a cell that will

75
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:30,023
take some of the proteins that
make up those viruses and

76
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:33,024
present them on the
MHC I complex.

77
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:38,023


78
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:42,025
So in the case of MHC II, this
is what triggered helper T

79
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,012
cells to say, hey,
you know what?

80
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:46,016
I found something floating
out here.

81
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,093
Here's a little piece of
it, Mr. Helper T cell.

82
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:52,029
Why don't you bond to this and
raise the alarm system?

83
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,094
Now the MHC I system
says, this isn't

84
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,087
stuff floating around.

85
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,081
I've been infected.

86
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,085
I am cancerous.

87
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,094
I'm going nuts.

88
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,097
You better kill me.

89
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:02,027
I'm a virus, I'm a virus-making
machine.

90
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,037
You better kill me.

91
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:08,063
And that message goes to the
cytotoxic T cells and that's

92
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:10,070
really the topic
of this video.

93
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,092
So just to make sure
you understand the

94
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,025
difference-- so T cells.

95
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:17,038
They both have T cell receptors,
but the helper T

96
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,040
cells bond to MHC
II complexes.

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,088


98
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:28,068
Let's say that this is a helper
T cell right here.

99
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:33,063
It would want to-- not all
helper T cells will.

100
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:36,047
Only the ones that have the
right combination, the right

101
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,095
variable portion right here that
just perfectly bonds to

102
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:44,006
this combination of an antigen
and the MHC II complex-- this

103
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:50,020
type of helper T cell will bond
here, get activated, and

104
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,012
start differentiating.

105
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:53,064
And the effector versions of
them will start raising the

106
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:56,023
alarms and the memory versions
of them will stick around in

107
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,055
case this type of thing
needs to happen again.

108
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:03,016
With MHC I, instead of
attracting a helper T cell, it

109
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:06,017
will attract a cytotoxic
T cell.

110
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:10,044


111
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:14,093
So like helper T cells, the
T cell receptor has a

112
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:21,054
non-variable portion, but it
also has a variable portion

113
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:26,043
that is specific to this
combination of

114
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:28,030
antigen and MHC II.

115
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,039
So maybe this cytotoxic T cell
will be involved when this

116
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,099
cell goes cancerous.

117
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:41,068
This cytotoxic T cell would be
of no use-- or it won't bond

118
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,052
to this one that was attracted
to a virus.

119
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:45,036
It's going to have to be
another cytotoxic T

120
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,072
cell that does that.

121
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,069
And the mechanism where we get
this variability in the helper

122
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,097
T cells or the cytotoxic T
cells or you saw in the B

123
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:56,036
cells on their membrane bound
antibodies, that all comes

124
00:06:56,036 --> 00:07:00,075
from when-- in their development
stage or in the

125
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:05,098
maturation process, the DNA that
codes for these variable

126
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:08,031
portions gets shuffled
around intentionally.

127
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,016
So normally, we're always
trying to preserve DNA

128
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:12,069
information, here it gets
shuffled around.

129
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:17,080
But anyway, once a cytotoxic T
cell finds one of these guys

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,062
on an MHC I-- remember, every
nucleated cell in the body has

131
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:25,007
an MHC I-- then what it does
is, it gets activated.

132
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:27,026
So let's say this guy says,
hey, that looks shady.

133
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:29,005
You need to die.

134
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,077
So this guy gets activated and
just like all other activated

135
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,098
cells, he starts to divide and
divide and divide and divide

136
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,000
and differentiate.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,093
And he divides and he
differentiates into memory,

138
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:41,042
just in case you're going to
need me again, just in case

139
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,057
this type of cancer
shows up again.

140
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:47,000
And then also into effector T
cells, which are the ones that

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,025
do the killing.

142
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,074


143
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:53,047
So this is an effector.

144
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:56,062
So let's say one of these
effectors-- they'll also bind

145
00:07:56,062 --> 00:08:00,002
to cancerous molecules,
cancerous cells,

146
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:00,076
just like this one.

147
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:04,037
So let's say this cell has
split and there's another

148
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:05,049
version of it right here.

149
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,057
That's what cancer does.

150
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,087
It divides aggressively.

151
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,093
It's producing wacky proteins.

152
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:15,083
It presents the wacky proteins
on its MCH-- major

153
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:21,007
histocompatibility type I
complex-- it displays the

154
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:25,025
wacky proteins and then one of
these effector cytotoxic T

155
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:32,025
cells will be attracted
to it just like that.

156
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,051
And I'm not going into details
on what necessarily does the

157
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:36,062
attractions and all the membrane
bound proteins.

158
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,025
If you take an immunology
class,

159
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,028
you'll see more on that.

160
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:44,030
So this is a cytotoxic T cell
and it essentially forces this

161
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,078
cell to kill itself in a couple
of different ways.

162
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:53,061
One, it actually can exocytose
a bunch of proteins.

163
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:59,023
They're call perforins-- that
make little holes in the

164
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,009
membrane of the cell.

165
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,076
And it has other proteins that
it releases called granzymes

166
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,015
that go in here and essentially
start mechanisms

167
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,015
that make this cell want
to kill itself.

168
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,097
So the big picture is, if you
want to just take 20,000 feet,

169
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:17,086
these cells are very effective
at produces-- so when a B cell

170
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:20,020
gets activated, it produces
antibodies that kill things

171
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,063
that are floating
around, right?

172
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:24,021
Once a B cell gets activated, it
starts producing a bunch of

173
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,074
antibodies.

174
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:28,097
These antibodies float around
and then they can bond up to

175
00:09:28,097 --> 00:09:31,060
viruses, make them ineffective,
or essentially

176
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,067
tag them for pickup from
macrophages or dendritic

177
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:39,089
cells, or other types of
phagocytes-- while cytotoxic T

178
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,036
cells-- these are used to
essentially kill cells that

179
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:44,038
have gone awry.

180
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,086
For example, a cancer cell
that's presenting weird

181
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,035
proteins or once the virus has
entered the cell, then the

182
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,085
antibodies are really
of no use.

183
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:52,087
The antibodies aren't
going to be able to

184
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,045
get into those cells.

185
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:57,026
In that case, instead of
cleaning up the virus itself,

186
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:00,001
a cytotoxic T cell will come
here and just kill this cell

187
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,029
because this cell is
a virus factory.

188
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,015
So you have to get it
out of the way.

189
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:05,093

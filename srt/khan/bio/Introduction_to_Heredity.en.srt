1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,049


2
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,079
Well, before we even knew what
DNA was, much less how it was

3
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:07,016
structured or it was replicated
or even before we

4
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:11,001
could look in and see meiosis
happening in cells, we had the

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,069
general sense that offspring
were the products of some

6
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:16,048
traits that their parents had.

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:22,017
That if I had a guy with blue
eyes-- let me say this is the

8
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:27,042
blue-eyed guy right here --and
then if he were to marry a

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:32,079
brown-eyed girl-- Let's say this
is the brown-eyed girl.

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,040
Maybe make it a little
bit more like a girl.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,045
If he were to marry the
brown-eyed girl there, that

12
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:42,022
most of the time, or maybe in
all cases where we're dealing

13
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:45,003
with the brown-eyed girl,
maybe their kids are

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,086
brown-eyed.

15
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:50,021
Let me do this so they have a
little brown-eyed baby here.

16
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:53,000


17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,097
And this is just something--
I mean, there's obviously

18
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,042
thousands of generations of
human beings, and we've

19
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,017
observed this.

20
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,059
We've observed that kids look
like their parents, that they

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,028
inherit some traits, and that
some traits seem to dominate

22
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:06,014
other traits.

23
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:09,095
One example of that tends to
be a darker pigmentation in

24
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:11,056
maybe the hair or the eyes.

25
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:15,070
Even if the other parent has
light pigmentation, the darker

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,090
one seems to dominate, or
sometimes, it actually ends up

27
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,042
being a mix, and we've seen
that all around us.

28
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,040
Now, this study of what gets
passed on and how it gets

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,059
passed on, it's much older than
the study of DNA, which

30
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:29,084
was really kind of discovered
or became a big deal in the

31
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,010
middle of the 20th century.

32
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,081
This was studied a long time.

33
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:36,075
And kind of the father of
classical genetics and

34
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,045
heredity is Gregor Mendel.

35
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,071


36
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:45,065
He was actually a monk, and he
would mess around with plants

37
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:48,079
and cross them and see which
traits got passed and which

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,023
traits didn't get passed and
tried to get an understanding

39
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:55,065
of how traits are passed from
one generation to another.

40
00:01:55,065 --> 00:02:02,009
So when we do this, when we
study this classical genetics,

41
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,023
I'm going to make a bunch of
simplifying assumptions

42
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:08,008
because we know that most of
these don't hold for most of

43
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,013
our genes, but it'll give us a
little bit of sense of how to

44
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:16,034
predict what might happen
in future generations.

45
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:21,027
So the first simplifying
assumption I'll make is that

46
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:24,084
some traits have kind of this
all or nothing property.

47
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,068
And we know that a lot
of traits don't.

48
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:28,068
Let's say that there are in
the world-- and this is a

49
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:35,021
gross oversimplification --let's
say for eye color,

50
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,052
let's say that there
are two alleles.

51
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:40,038
Now remember what
an allele was.

52
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:44,003
An allele is a specific
version of a gene.

53
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:48,040
So let's say that you could
have blue eye color or you

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,046
could have brown eye color.

55
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,021
That we live in a universe where
someone could only have

56
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,031
one of these two versions
of the eye color gene.

57
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:01,022
We know that eye color is far
more complex than that, so

58
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:02,096
this is just a simplification.

59
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:04,034
And let me just make
up another one.

60
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:14,011
Let me say that, I don't know,
maybe for tooth size, that's a

61
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:17,059
trait you won't see in any
traditional biology textbook,

62
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:23,046
and let's say that there's one
trait for big teeth and

63
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:28,033
there's another allele
for small teeth.

64
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,084
And I want to make very clear
this distinction between a

65
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,009
gene and an allele.

66
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,022


67
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,074
I talked about Gregor Mendel,
and he was doing this in the

68
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:41,088
1850s well before we knew what
DNA was or what even

69
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:48,059
chromosomes were and how DNA was
passed on, et cetera, but

70
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:53,006
let's go into the microbiology
of it to understand the

71
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:53,084
difference.

72
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:56,016
So I have a chromosome.

73
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:59,071
Let's say on some chromosome--
let me pick

74
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,090
some chromosome here.

75
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,093
Let's say this is
some chromosome.

76
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,059
Let's say I got that
from my dad.

77
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:09,012
And on this chromosome, there's
some location here--

78
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,055
we could call that the locus on
this chromosome where the

79
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:15,033
eye color gene is --that's
the location of

80
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,057
the eye color gene.

81
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:19,027
Now, I have two chromosomes,
one from my father and one

82
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:22,000
from my mother, so let's say
that this is the chromosome

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,025
from my mother.

84
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:26,001


85
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,080
We know that when they're
normally in the cell, they

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,018
aren't nice and neatly organized
like this in the

87
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:32,086
chromosome, but this is just to
kind of show you the idea.

88
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:35,068
Let's say these are homologous
chromosomes so they code for

89
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,097
the same genes.

90
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:41,045
So on this gene from my mother
on that same location or

91
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:45,070
locus, there's also the
eye color gene.

92
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:51,001
Now, I might have the same
version of the gene and I'm

93
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,075
saying that there's only
two versions of

94
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:54,022
this gene in the world.

95
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:56,068
Now, if I have the same version
of the gene-- I'm

96
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:58,050
going to make a little
shorthand notation.

97
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,010
I'm going to write big B--
Actually, let me do

98
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,000
it the other way.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,004
I'm going to write little b
for blue and I'm going to

100
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,042
write big B for brown.

101
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:11,020
There's a situation where this
could be a little b and this

102
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,080
could be a big B.

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,000
And then I could write that my
genotype-- I have the allele,

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,031
I have one big B from my
mom and I have one

105
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:24,043
small b from my dad.

106
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:29,012
Each of these instances, or
ways that this gene is

107
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,066
expressed, is an allele.

108
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:40,036
So these are two different
alleles-- let me write that

109
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:42,087
--or versions of
the same gene.

110
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:46,033
And when I have two different
versions like this, one

111
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:50,013
version from my mom, one version
from my dad, I'm

112
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:53,048
called a heterozygote, or
sometimes it's called a

113
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,073
heterozygous genotype.

114
00:05:54,073 --> 00:06:00,041


115
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:05,000
And the genotype is the exact
version of the alleles I have.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,017
Let's say I had the
lowercase b.

117
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:11,068
I had the blue-eyed gene
from both parents.

118
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:16,004
So let's say that I was
lowercase b, lowercase b, then

119
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,060
I would have two identical
alleles.

120
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,083
Both of my parents gave me the
same version of the gene.

121
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:29,093
And this case, this genotype
is homozygous, or this is a

122
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:33,089
homozygous genotype, or I'm a
homozygote for this trait.

123
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,039


124
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,050
Now, you might say,
Sal, this is fine.

125
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,039
These are the traits that you
have. I have a brown from

126
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,055
maybe my mom and a
blue from my dad.

127
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:50,085
In this case, I have a blue
from both my mom and dad.

128
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:54,058
How do we know whether my eyes
are going to be brown or blue?

129
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,089
And the reality is it's
very complex.

130
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,041
It's a whole mixture
of things.

131
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,082
But Mendel, he studied
things that showed

132
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:04,007
what we'll call dominance.

133
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:09,025


134
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:12,093
And this is the idea that
one of these traits

135
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,008
dominates the other.

136
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:17,016
So a lot of people originally
thought that eye color,

137
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:20,049
especially blue eyes,
was always dominated

138
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,050
by the other traits.

139
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,013
We'll assume that here,
but that's a gross

140
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:24,050
oversimplification.

141
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:34,019
So let's say that brown
eyes are dominant

142
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,012
and blue are recessive.

143
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:39,031


144
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:42,095
I wanted to do that in blue.

145
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:49,056
Blue eyes are recessive.

146
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:52,032
If this is the case, and this
is a-- As I've said

147
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:55,073
repeatedly, this is a gross
oversimplification.

148
00:07:55,073 --> 00:08:00,067
But if that is the case, then
if I were to inherit this

149
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:05,054
genotype, because brown eyes
are dominant-- remember, I

150
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:12,039
said the big B here represents
brown eye and the lowercase b

151
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,067
is recessive --all you're going
to see for the person

152
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,044
with this genotype
is brown eyes.

153
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,087
So let me do this here.

154
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:21,070
Let me write this here.

155
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:27,068
So genotype, and then I'll
write phenotype.

156
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:31,002
Genotype is the actual versions
of the gene you have

157
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:33,077
and then the phenotypes
are what's expressed

158
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,002
or what do you see.

159
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,069


160
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:43,086
So if I get a brown-eyed gene
from my dad-- And I want to do

161
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:46,030
it in a big-- I want
to do it in brown.

162
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,066
Let me do it in brown so
you don't get confused.

163
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:54,049
So if I've have a brown-eyed
gene from my dad and a

164
00:08:54,049 --> 00:09:05,012
blue-eyed gene from my mom,
because the brown eye is

165
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,058
recessive, the brown-eyed allele
is recessive-- And I

166
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:11,037
just said a brown-eyed gene, but
what I should say is the

167
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:13,087
brown-eyed version of the
gene, which is the brown

168
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,082
allele, or the blue-eyed version
of the gene from my

169
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,088
mom, which is the blue allele.

170
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:22,028
Since the brown allele is
dominant-- I wrote that up

171
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,040
here --what's going to be
expressed are brown eyes.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,083


173
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:34,045
Now, let's say I had
it the other way.

174
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:39,085
Let's say I got a blue-eyed
allele from my dad and I get a

175
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:41,075
brown-eyed allele for my mom.

176
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,049
Same thing.

177
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,094
The phenotype is going
to be brown eyes.

178
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:49,073
Now, what if I get a brown-eyed
allele from both my

179
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:52,047
mom and my dad?

180
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,092
Let me see, I keep changing
the shade of brown, but

181
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,096
they're all supposed
to be the same.

182
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:59,012
So let's say I get two dominant
brown-eyed alleles

183
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,082
from my mom and my dad.

184
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,076
Then what are you
going to see?

185
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,063
Well, you could guess that.

186
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:08,027
I'm still going to
see brown eyes.

187
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,057
So there's only one last
combination because these are

188
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:12,079
the only two types of alleles
we might see in our

189
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,050
population, although for
most genes, there's

190
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,071
more than two types.

191
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:18,039
For example, there's
blood types.

192
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,049
There's four types of blood.

193
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:25,053
But let's say that I get two
blue, one blue allele from

194
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:30,039
each of my parents, one from
my dad, one from my mom.

195
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,008
Then all of a sudden, this is a
recessive trait, but there's

196
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,054
nothing to dominate it.

197
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:39,012
So, all of a sudden, the
phenotype will be blue eyes.

198
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:42,037
And I want to repeat again, this
isn't necessarily how the

199
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:45,012
alleles for eye color work, but
it's a nice simplification

200
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,037
to maybe understand how
heredity works.

201
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:52,003
There are some traits that can
be studied in this simple way.

202
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:54,091
But what I wanted to do here
is to show you that many

203
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:58,097
different genotypes-- so these
are all different genotypes

204
00:10:58,097 --> 00:11:02,009
--they all coded for
the same phenotype.

205
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,000
So just by looking at someone's
eye color, you

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
didn't know exactly whether
they were homozygous

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,074
dominant-- this would be
homozygous dominant --or

208
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:19,008
whether they were
heterozygotes.

209
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,035
This is heterozygous
right here.

210
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,064
These two right here
are heterozygotes.

211
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:27,099


212
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:31,067
These are also sometimes called
hybrids, but the word

213
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,060
hybrid is kind of overloaded.

214
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,079
It's used a lot, but in this
context, it means that you got

215
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,094
different versions of the
allele for that gene.

216
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:43,074
So let's think a little bit
about what's actually

217
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:48,015
happening when my mom and
my dad reproduced.

218
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:50,097


219
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:53,010
Well, let's think of a couple
of different scenarios.

220
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,095


221
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:57,062
Let's say that they're
both hybrids.

222
00:11:57,062 --> 00:12:03,047
My dad has the brown-eyed
dominant allele and he also

223
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:08,001
has the blue-eyed recessive
allele.

224
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:11,055
Let's say my mom has the same
thing, so brown-eyed dominant,

225
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:14,077
and she also has the blue-eyed
recessive allele.

226
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:17,087
Now let's think about if these
two people, before you see

227
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:20,062
what my eye color is, if you
said, look, I'm giving you

228
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,075
what these two people's
genotypes are.

229
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,000
Let me label them.

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,020


231
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,078
Let me make this the mom.

232
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,009
I think this is the standard
convention.

233
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:34,073
And let's make this right
here, this is the dad.

234
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:37,090
What are the different genotypes
that their children

235
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,049
could have?

236
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,062
So let's say they reproduce.

237
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:44,009
I'm going to draw a
little grid here.

238
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,065
So let me draw a grid.

239
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:50,038


240
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:55,099
So we know from our study of
meiosis that, look, my mom has

241
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:59,087
this gene on-- Let me draw
the genes again.

242
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:02,024
So there's a homologous
pair, right?

243
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:04,087
This is one chromosome
right here.

244
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,007
That's another chromosome
right there.

245
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:10,012
On this chromosome in the
homologous pair, there might

246
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:16,075
be-- at the eye color locus
--there's the brown-eyed gene.

247
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:19,047
And at this one, at the eye
color locus, there's a

248
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:20,088
blue-eyed gene.

249
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:24,062
And similarly from my dad, when
you look at that same

250
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:28,030
chromosome in his cells-- Let
me do them like this.

251
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,074
So this is one chromosome there
and this is the other

252
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,075
chromosome here.

253
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:35,012
When you look at that locus
on this chromosome or that

254
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:37,087
location, it has the brown-eyed
allele for that

255
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:40,037
gene, and on this one,
it has the blue-eyed

256
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:41,059
allele on this gene.

257
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:44,067
And we learn from meiosis when
the chromosomes-- Well, they

258
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,058
replicate first, and so you have
these two chromatids on a

259
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,013
chromosome.

260
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:51,051
But they line up in meiosis
I during the metaphase.

261
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,022
And we don't know which
way they line up.

262
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:56,050
For example, my dad might give
me this chromosome or might

263
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,062
give me that chromosome.

264
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,078
Or my mom might give me that
chromosome or might give me

265
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,082
that chromosome.

266
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:02,075
So I could have any of
these combinations.

267
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:06,053
So, for example, if I get this
chromosome from my mom and

268
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,075
this chromosome from my dad,
what is the genotype going to

269
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,000
be for eye color?

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,076
Well, it's going to be capital
B and capital B.

271
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:21,050
If I get this chromosome from
my mom and this chromosome

272
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,062
from my dad, what's
it going to be?

273
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:28,033
Well, I'm going to get the big
B from my dad and then I'm

274
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,078
going to get the lowercase
b from my mom.

275
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,078
So this is another
possibility.

276
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,050
Now, this is another possibility
here where I get

277
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:42,049
the brown-eyed allele from my
mom and I get the blue eye

278
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,037
allele from my dad.

279
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:47,035
And then there's a possibility
that I get this chromosome

280
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:51,025
from my dad and this chromosome
from my mom, so

281
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,051
it's this situation.

282
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,070
Now, what are the phenotypes
going to be?

283
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,028
Well, we've already seen that
this one right here is going

284
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:03,008
to be brown, that one's going to
be brown, this one's going

285
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:06,025
to be brown, but this one
is going to be blue.

286
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,086
I already showed you this.

287
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,098
But if I were to tell you ahead
of time that, look, I

288
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:11,009
have two people.

289
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,098
They're both hybrids, or they're
both heterozygotes for

290
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:16,061
eye color, and eye
color has this

291
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,033
recessive dominant situation.

292
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:22,052
And they're both heterozygotes
where they each have one brown

293
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,098
allele and one blue allele, and
they're going to have a

294
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:28,083
child, what's the probability
that the child has brown eyes?

295
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:35,066


296
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,016
What's the probability?

297
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:40,072
Well, each of these scenarios
are equally likely, right?

298
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,039
There's four equal scenarios.

299
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,012
So let's put that in
the denominator.

300
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,095
Four equal scenarios.

301
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:48,011
And how many of those
scenarios end

302
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:49,077
up with brown eyes?

303
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:52,011
Well, it's one, two, three.

304
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:58,077
So the probability is 3/4, or
it's a 75% probability.

305
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:01,083
Same logic, what's the
probability that these parents

306
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,064
produce an offspring
with blue eyes?

307
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:07,027
Well, that's only one of
the four equally likely

308
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:15,084
possibilities, so blue
eyes is only 25%.

309
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:19,039
Now, what is the probability
that they produce a

310
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,038
heterozygote?

311
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:23,012
So what is the probability
that they produce a

312
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,042
heterozygous offspring?

313
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:27,036


314
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,029
So now we're not looking at
the phenotype anymore.

315
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,004
We're looking at the genotype.

316
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:34,030
So of these combinations,
which are heterozygous?

317
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,057
Well, this one is, because
it has a mix.

318
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,036
It's a hybrid.

319
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:39,037
It has a mix of the
two alleles.

320
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,016
And so is this one.

321
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,022
So what's the probability?

322
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,004
Well, there's four different
combinations.

323
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,001
All of those are equally likely,
and two of them result

324
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,020
in a heterozygote.

325
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,058
So it's 2/4 or 1/2 or 50%.

326
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,057
So using this Punnett square,
and, of course, we had to make

327
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,087
a lot of assumptions about the
genes and whether one's

328
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:02,004
dominant or one's a recessive,
we can start to make

329
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,087
predictions about the
probabilities

330
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,052
of different outcomes.

331
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:07,029
And as we'll see in future
videos, you can actually even

332
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,097
go backwards.

333
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:10,068
You can say, hey, given that
this couple had five kids with

334
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:14,016
brown eyes, what's the
probability that they're both

335
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,081
heterozygotes, or something
like that.

336
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:19,000
So it's a really interesting
area, even though it is a bit

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,049
of oversimplification.

338
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:23,075
But many traits, especially some
of the things that Gregor

339
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:27,019
Mendel studied, can be
studied in this way.

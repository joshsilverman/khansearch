1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,052


2
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:03,067
A couple of videos ago, we
saw that in classic C-3

3
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:06,024
photosynthesis-- and once again
it's called C-3 because

4
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:13,076
the first time that carbon
dioxide is fixed, it's fixed

5
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,047
into a 3-carbon molecule.

6
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:18,058
But we saw the problem with C-3
photosynthesis is that the

7
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:22,057
enzyme that does the carbon
fixation, it can also react

8
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:23,042
with oxygen.

9
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:27,046
And when oxygen essentially
reacts with ribulose

10
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:30,010
biphosphate instead of your
carbon, you get an

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,032
unproductive reaction.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,039
Not only is it unproductive,
it'll actually suck up your

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,089
ATP and your NADPH and
you'll go nowhere.

14
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:38,053
So every now and then, when
oxygen bonds here instead of a

15
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:42,024
carbon dioxide, you get
nothing produced, net.

16
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:43,090
Everything becomes
less efficient.

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,074
And so in the last video, we
saw that some plants have

18
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:52,065
evolved a way to get
around this.

19
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:56,039
And what they do is, they fix
their carbon on the outside,

20
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,092
on cells that are actually
exposed to the air.

21
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,009
And then once they fix the
carbon they actually fix it

22
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:05,084
into a 4-carbon molecule, into
oxaloacetate And then that

23
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:08,073
gets turned into malate Then
they pump the malate deeper

24
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:11,093
within the leaf, where you
aren't exposed to oxygen.

25
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:14,071
And then they take the carbon
dioxide off the malate, and

26
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,093
this is where they actually
perform the Calvin cycle.

27
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:20,054
And even though you do have
your rubiscos still there,

28
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:23,082
your rubisco isn't going to
have-- the photorespiration is

29
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,098
not going to occur.

30
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:26,098
Because it only has access
to carbon dioxide.

31
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,070
It does not have access to
this oxygen out here.

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,095
Now that's a very efficient
way of producing sugars.

33
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:34,062
And that's why some of the
plants that we associate with

34
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:38,009
being very strong sugar, or even
ethanol producers, all

35
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,060
perform C-4 photosynthesis.

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:49,035
Corn, sugarcane,
and crab grass.

37
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,084
And these are all very, very
efficient sugar producers.

38
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,026
Because they don't have to
worry too much about

39
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,089
photorespiration.

40
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:57,040
Now some plants have a slightly
different problem.

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,096
They're not so worried about the
efficiency of the process.

42
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:03,075
They're more worried
about losing water.

43
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,004
And you can imagine what
plants these are.

44
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,015
These are plants that
are in the desert.

45
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,090
Because these stomata, these
pores that are on the leaves,

46
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,071
they let in air, but they
can also let out water.

47
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:16,096
I mean, if I'm in the
rainforest, I

48
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,008
don't care about that.

49
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,021
But if I'm in the middle of the
desert, I don't want to

50
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:23,022
let out water vapor through
my stomata.

51
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:26,046
So the ideal situation is, I
would want my stomata closed

52
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,013
during the daytime.

53
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,072
This is what I want.

54
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:32,012
So I want-- if I'm in
the desert, let

55
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:34,050
me make this clear.

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:46,031
If I'm in the desert I want
stomata closed during the day.

57
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,022
For obvious reasons.

58
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,058
I don't want all my water
to vaporize out of

59
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:51,009
these holes in my leaves.

60
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:56,090
But at the same time, the
problem is that photosynthesis

61
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,058
can only occur during
the daytime.

62
00:02:58,058 --> 00:02:59,087
And that includes the
dark reactions.

63
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:02,003
Remember, I've said multiple
times, the dark reactions are

64
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:02,068
badly named.

65
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:04,080
They're more the light
independent reactions.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,021
But they both occur
simultaneously-- the light

67
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,059
independent and light
dependent-- and only during

68
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,084
the daytime.

69
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:21,040


70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,036
And if your stomata is closed,
you need to perform

71
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:30,018
photosynthesis, especially the
Calvin cycle, you need CO2.

72
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,065
So how can you get
around this?

73
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:34,087
If I want to close my stomata
during the day, but I need CO2

74
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:37,065
during the day, how can
I solve this problem?

75
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:40,069
And what desert plants, or
many desert plants, have

76
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,024
evolved to do, essentially
does photosynthesis, but

77
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:49,025
instead of fixing the carbon
in outer cells and then

78
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:52,006
pushing it in to inner cells and
then performing the Calvin

79
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:55,037
cycle, instead of outer and
inner cells, they do it at the

80
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:58,009
nighttime and in the daytime.

81
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:01,093
So in CAM plants-- and these are
called CAM plants because,

82
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,023
I could tell you what
it stands for.

83
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:06,018
It stands for crassulacean
acid metabolism.

84
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:09,037
And that's because it was first
observed in that species

85
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:11,019
of plants, the crassulacean
plant.

86
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,025
But these are just called,
you could call it CAM

87
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,071
photosynthesis or CAM plants.

88
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:19,048
They're essentially a subset
of C-4 plants.

89
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,002
But instead of performing C-4
photosynthesis, kind of an

90
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,067
outside cells and inside cells,
they do it at the

91
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,092
nighttime and the day.

92
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:33,042


93
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:40,054
And what they do is, at night
they keep their stomata open.

94
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:44,088


95
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:50,018
And they perform, and they're
able to fix-- and everything

96
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,095
occurs in the mesophyll
cells and the CAM

97
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:54,029
cells, in the CAM plants.

98
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,035
So at nighttime, when they're
not afraid of losing water--

99
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,079
let's say this is a mesophyll
cell right here--

100
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,016
my stomata is open.

101
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:06,027
Let's say that this is my
stomata right there.

102
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,008
And so it lets in
carbon dioxide.

103
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,087
I'm not worried about
losing water vapor.

104
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,018
It's night time right now.

105
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:14,014
So carbon dioxide
comes in here.

106
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,087
And then it fixes the
carbon dioxide.

107
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,064
It fixes it the exact same way
that the C-4 plants do.

108
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:23,007
So you have your CO2 come in.

109
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:26,068
You have your PEP .

110
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:30,091
It's all facilitated by PEP
carboxylase That's the enzyme.

111
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:34,056
That can only fix CO2, that can
only react with CO2, not

112
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:35,047
with oxygen.

113
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:39,043
And then that is used to
produce-- and we saw it here

114
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:44,045
in our CAM-4 diagram in the last
video, that is to used to

115
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,049
produce malate.

116
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:48,002
A 4-carbon molecule.

117
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:52,092


118
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:55,037
And then the malate-- and then
this is what's key-- the

119
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:58,063
malate get stored in other
organelles in the cell.

120
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,077
In the vacuoles , which are, you
can kind of view them as

121
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,092
large storage containers
in the cell.

122
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,062
So I drew this as
the whole cell.

123
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:08,099
I mean, this is actually all
occurring in your chloroplast.

124
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,043
But you can imagine your cell
having a big storage center

125
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:15,018
where the malate gets
stored at night.

126
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:18,048
And you can view malate as
almost a carbon dioxide store.

127
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:20,075
Because later on we can
access the malate and

128
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,018
get the carbon dioxide.

129
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,067
And that's exactly what these
CAM plants are going to do.

130
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,037
So this is nighttime.

131
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,051
Then the sun comes up.

132
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:31,005
So now we're in the daytime.

133
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:34,025
This desert plant, well maybe
it's a cactus, it doesn't want

134
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,062
to lose its water vapor.

135
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,087
So it closes its stomata.

136
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:39,029


137
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,011
This particular stoma
now is closed.

138
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,008
It's now closed.

139
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:45,037
And you say, oh boy, how
is it going to perform

140
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,068
photosynthesis?

141
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:48,080
Well, it can perform
photosynthesis in

142
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,008
that very same cell.

143
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,082


144
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:56,066
Because it stored up all of
this malate at night.

145
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:59,087
And so now the malate can be
pumped out of the vacuoles

146
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:03,094
into the stroma of our
chloroplast. And then you can

147
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:05,045
have pyruvate break off.

148
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,099
But the more important thing
is you have CO2 break off.

149
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,016
So you have a ready
supply of CO2.

150
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:13,029
And now we can perform our
standard Calvin cycle.

151
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,004
And in an environment only
with CO2, our stomata is

152
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,030
closed, so we're ready to go.

153
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,032
Our CO2 reacts with ribulose
bisphosphate It is catalyzed

154
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:27,042
by rubisco It's the whole
Calvin cycle and we

155
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,066
produced our sugar.

156
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:32,033
So this is kind of a
neat adaptation.

157
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:35,050
In these high, very efficient
sugar-producing plants that

158
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,043
aren't worried about water, they
perform carbon fixation

159
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:42,068
on things that are exposed to
the air and then they pump

160
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:45,016
kind of a stored version of
the carbon deeper into the

161
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:48,027
leaf to actually perform the
Calvin cycle so that it's not

162
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:49,007
lossy, so that

163
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:50,037
photorespiration doesn't occur.

164
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,075
Because down here you
have no oxygen.

165
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:56,069
The desert plants benefit from
that property as well, but

166
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,081
their whole concern is, I don't
want to keep my stomata

167
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,037
open in the daytime.

168
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:02,064
So what I do is, I fix
my carbon at night.

169
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,016
But I use the exact
same process.

170
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,082
I use PEP carboxylase
And I store my

171
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:10,054
carbon dioxide at night.

172
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:15,093
And in the daytime, I can
actually-- when my

173
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,031
light-dependant reactions are
occurring, they're producing

174
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,077
my ATP and my NADH I can also
perform my dark reactions in

175
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,041
the daytime.

176
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,055
As I said, the dark reactions
always occur in the daytime.

177
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,043
Or my light-independent
reactions.

178
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:31,079
Because even though my stomata
is closed, I have a store of

179
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,022
carbon dioxide in the
form of malate.

180
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,008

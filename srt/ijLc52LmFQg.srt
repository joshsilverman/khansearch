1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,056


2
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:02,006
We've gone over the
general idea

3
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:03,060
behind mitosis and meiosis.

4
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,082
It's a good idea in
this video to go a

5
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:05,073
little bit more in detail.

6
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:08,023
I've already done a video on
mitosis, and in this one,

7
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:11,013
we'll go into the details
of meiosis.

8
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:17,071
Just as a review, mitosis, you
start with a diploid cell, and

9
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,026
you end up with two
diploid cells.

10
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:23,005
Essentially, it just
duplicates itself.

11
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,053
And formally, mitosis is really
the process of the

12
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:27,080
duplication of the nucleus, but
it normally ends up with

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,035
two entire cells.

14
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,011
Cytokinesis takes place.

15
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,088
So this is mitosis.

16
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:36,002
We have a video on it where we
go into the phases of it:

17
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:39,028
prophase, metaphase, anaphase
and telophase.

18
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:45,004


19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:49,079
Mitosis occurs in pretty much
all of our somatic cells as

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,081
our skin cells replicate, and
our hair cells and all the

21
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,007
tissue in our body as it
duplicates itself, it goes

22
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,017
through mitosis.

23
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,096
Meiosis occurs in the germ
cells and it's used

24
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:06,095
essentially to produce gametes
to facilitate sexual

25
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:07,062
reproduction.

26
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:13,001
So if I start off with a diploid
cell, and that's my

27
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,056
diploid cell right there, this
would be a germ cell.

28
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,070
It's not just any cell
in the body.

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,067
It's a germ cell.

30
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,087
It could undergo mitosis to
produce more germ cells, but

31
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,078
we'll talk about how it
produces the gametes.

32
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,042
It actually goes under
two rounds.

33
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,095
They're combined, called
meiosis, but the first round

34
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:35,067
you could call it meiosis
1, so I'll call that M1.

35
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,084
I'm not talking about the
money supply here.

36
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:41,017
And in the first round of
meiosis, this diploid cell

37
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,026
essentially splits into
two haploid cells.

38
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:49,018
So if you started off with 43
chromosomes, formally have 23

39
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:52,010
chromosomes in each one, or you
can almost view it if you

40
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,023
have 23 pairs here, each have
two chromosomes, those pairs

41
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:58,093
get split into this stage.

42
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:06,084
And then in meiosis 2, these
things get split in a

43
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:11,005
mechanism very similar
to mitosis.

44
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,000
We'll see that when we actually

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,090
go through the phases.

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,015
In fact, the prophase,
metaphase, anaphase, telophase

47
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,079
also exist in each of these
phases of meiosis.

48
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,009
So let me just draw
the end product.

49
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:27,049
The end product is you have four
cells and each of them

50
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,074
are haploid.

51
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:32,021


52
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,052
And you could already see, this
process right here, you

53
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:39,025
essentially split up your
chromosomes, because you end

54
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,078
up with half in each one, but
here, you start with N and you

55
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,018
end up with two chromosomes that
each have N, so it's very

56
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:44,075
similar to this.

57
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,037
You preserve the number
of chromosomes.

58
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:49,038
So let's delve into the details
of how it all happens.

59
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:53,028
So all cells spend most of
their time in interphase.

60
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:57,090
Interphase is just a time when
the cell is living and

61
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,077
transcribing and doing
what it needs to do.

62
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:05,003
But just like in mitosis, one
key thing does happen during

63
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:07,097
the interphase, and actually,
it happens during the same

64
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:10,038
thing, the S phase of
the interphase.

65
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:15,037
So if that's my cell, that's
my nucleus right here.

66
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:17,058
And I'm going to draw it as
chromosomes, but you have to

67
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:22,043
remember that when we're outside
of mitosis or meiosis

68
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:26,034
formally, the chromosomes are
all unwound, and they exist as

69
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,043
chromatin, which we've
talked about before.

70
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:31,019
It's kind of the unwound
state of the DNA.

71
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,094
But I'm going to draw them wound
up because I need to

72
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:35,005
show you that they replicate.

73
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,075
Now, I'm going to be a
little careful here.

74
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:40,028
In the mitosis video, I just
had two chromosomes.

75
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:42,034
They replicated and then
they split apart.

76
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:44,091
When we talk about meiosis, we
have to be careful to show the

77
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,066
homologous pairs.

78
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,009
So let's say that I have
two homologous pairs.

79
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:54,009
So let's say I have-- let me do
it in appropriate colors.

80
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,080
So this is the one I
got from my dad.

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,065
This is the one I
got from my mom.

82
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:00,046
They're homologous.

83
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,013
And let's say that I have
another one that

84
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,038
I got from my dad.

85
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:06,061


86
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,077
Let me do it in blue.

87
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:10,062
Actually, maybe I should do all
the ones from my dad in

88
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:11,090
this color.

89
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,056
Maybe it's a little
bit longer.

90
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,065
You get the idea.

91
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:17,026
And then a homologous one for
my mom that's also a little

92
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,058
bit longer.

93
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:22,001
Now, during the S phase of the
interphase-- and this is just

94
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,069
like what happens in mitosis,
so you can almost view it as

95
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,049
it always happens during
interphase.

96
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,081
It doesn't happen in either
meiosis or mitosis.

97
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:32,064
You have replication
of your DNA.

98
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,075
So each of these from the
homologous pair-- and

99
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:37,026
remember, homologous pairs
mean that they're not

100
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,089
identical chromosomes,
but they do code

101
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:41,004
for the same genes.

102
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,075
They might have different
versions or different alleles

103
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,043
for a gene or for a certain
trait, but they code

104
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:48,050
essentially for the same
kind of stuff.

105
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,087
Now, replication of these, so
each of these chromosomes in

106
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,057
this pair replicate.

107
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:59,068
So that one from my dad
replicates like this, it

108
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:02,068
replicates and it's connected
by a centromere, and the one

109
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:08,070
from my mom replicates like
that, and it's connected by a

110
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,000
centromere like that, and then
the other one does as well.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's the shorter one.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,025
Oh, that's the longer
one, actually.

113
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:15,011
That's the longer one.

114
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,022
I should be a little bit more
explicit in which one's

115
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:18,018
shorter and longer.

116
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,098
The one from my mom does
the same thing.

117
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,072
This is in the S phase
of interphase.

118
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:25,082
We haven't entered the actual
cell division yet.

119
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,031
And the same thing is true-- and
this is kind of a little

120
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,082
bit of a sideshow-- of
the centrosomes.

121
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:33,037
And we saw in the mitosis video
that these are involved

122
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:37,023
in kind of eventually creating
the microtubule structure in

123
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:40,056
pulling everything apart, but
you'll have one centrosome

124
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:43,044
that's hanging out here, and
then it facilitates its own

125
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:46,013
replication, so then you
have two centrosomes.

126
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,037
So this is all occurring
in the interphase, and

127
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,049
particularly in the S part
of the interphase,

128
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,094
not the growth part.

129
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:59,004
But once that's happens, we're
ready-- in fact, we're ready

130
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:02,040
for either mitosis or meiosis,
but we're going

131
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,027
to do meiosis now.

132
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:04,099
This is a germ cell.

133
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:09,012
So what happens is we enter
into prophase I.

134
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:11,036
So if you remember, in my-- let
me write this down because

135
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,055
I think it's important.

136
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:22,093
In mitosis you have prophase,
metaphase,

137
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:26,072
anaphase and telophase.

138
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:28,042
I won't keep writing
phase down.

139
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,093
PMAT.

140
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:33,042
In meiosis, you experience these
in each stage, so you

141
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:38,031
have to prophase I, followed
by metaphase I, followed by

142
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,000
anaphase I, followed
by telophase I.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,072
Then after you've done meiosis
1, then it all happens again.

144
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:47,079
You have prophase II, followed
by metaphase II, followed by

145
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,049
anaphase II, followed
by telophase.

146
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:53,005
So if you really just want to
memorize the names, which you

147
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,067
unfortunately have to do in
this, especially if you're

148
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,082
going to get tested on it,
although it's not that

149
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,099
important to kind of understand
the concept of

150
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,041
what's happening, you just have
to remember prophase,

151
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,026
metaphase, anaphase, telophase,
and it'll really

152
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,014
cover everything.

153
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:09,048
You just after memorize in
meiosis, it's happening twice.

154
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,037
And what's happening is a little
bit different, and

155
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,093
that's what I really want
to focus on here.

156
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:17,025
So let's enter prophase
I of meiosis I.

157
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:23,058
So let me call this
prophase I.

158
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:25,020
So what's going to happen?

159
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,025
So just like in prophase and
mitosis, a couple of things

160
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:29,082
start happening.

161
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:35,072
Your nuclear envelope
starts disappearing.

162
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:42,068


163
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:45,018
The centromeres-- sorry,
not centromeres.

164
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:45,075
I'm getting confused now.

165
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,042
The centrosomes.

166
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,075
The centromeres are these things
connecting these sister

167
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:51,013
chromatids.

168
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:55,068
The centrosomes start
facilitating the development

169
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,049
of the spindles, and they start
pushing apart a little

170
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:02,020
bit from the spindles.

171
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,082
They start pushing apart and
going to opposite sides of the

172
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,061
chromosomes.

173
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,027
And this is the really important
thing in prophase I.

174
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,062
And actually, I'll
make this point.

175
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:13,086
Remember, in interface, even
though I drew it this way,

176
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:16,029
they don't exist in this state,
the actual chromosomes.

177
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,002
They exist more in a
chromatin state.

178
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:23,030
So if I were to really draw it,
it would look like this.

179
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,080
The chromosomes, it would all be
all over the place, and it

180
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,056
actually would be very difficult
to actually see it

181
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:29,099
in a microscope.

182
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,091
It would just be a big mess of
proteins and of histones,

183
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,064
which are proteins, and
the actual DNA.

184
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:40,013
And that's what's actually
referred to as the chromatin.

185
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:44,029
Now, in prophase, that starts to
form into the chromosomes.

186
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,016
It starts to have a little bit
of structure, and this is

187
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,071
completely analogous
to what happens

188
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:50,041
in prophase in mitosis.

189
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,000
Now, the one interesting thing
that happens is that the

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,032
homologous pairs line up.

191
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:57,041
And actually, I drew it like
that over here and maybe I

192
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,030
should just cut and paste it.

193
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,090
Let me just do that.

194
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:10,032
If I just cut and paste that,
although I said that the

195
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:14,045
nucleus is disappearing, so let
me get rid of the nucleus.

196
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,035
I already said that.

197
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:18,058
The nucleus is slowly
disassembling.

198
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,012
The proteins are coming apart
during this prophase I.

199
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,023
I won't draw the whole cell,
because what's interesting

200
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:28,073
here is happening at the
nuclear, or what once was the

201
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:30,032
nucleus level.

202
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:34,007
So the interesting thing here
that's different from mitosis

203
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,017
is that the homologous pairs
line up next to each other.

204
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:41,051
Not only do they line up, but
they can actually share-- they

205
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,087
can actually have genetic
recombination.

206
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:47,070
So you have these points where
analogous-- or I guess you

207
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,096
could say homologous-- points
on two of these chromosomes

208
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,024
will cross over each other.

209
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,065
So let me draw that in detail.

210
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:59,061
So let me just focus on maybe
these two right here.

211
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:05,095
So I have one chromosome from
my dad, and it's made up of

212
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,039
two chromatids, so it's already
replicated, but we

213
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,087
only consider it one chromosome,
and then I have

214
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:16,003
one from my mom in green.

215
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:18,091
I'm going to draw
it like that.

216
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:23,037
One from my mom in green, and
it also has two chromatids.

217
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:27,057
Sometimes this is called a
tetrad because it has four

218
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:32,012
chromatids in it, but it's
in a pair of homologous

219
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,050
chromosomes.

220
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,075
These are the centromeres,
of course.

221
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:38,073
What happens is you have
crossing over, and it's a

222
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:42,076
surprisingly organized
process.

223
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,051
When I say organized,
it crosses over at

224
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,045
a homologous point.

225
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:49,045
It crosses over at a point
where, for the most part,

226
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:52,035
you're exchanging
similar genes.

227
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,069
It's not like one is getting two
versions of a gene and the

228
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,050
other is getting two versions
of another gene.

229
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,085
You're changing in a way that
both chromosomes are still

230
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,061
coding for the different genes,
but they're getting

231
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:05,066
different versions of those
genes or different alleles,

232
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,024
which are just versions
of those genes.

233
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:12,001
So once this is done, the ones
from my father are now not

234
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,087
completely from my father,
so it might look

235
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,013
something like this.

236
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,046
Let me see, it'll
look like this.

237
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:20,086
The one from my father now has
this little bit from my

238
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:25,048
mother, and the one from my--
oh, no, my mother's chromosome

239
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:29,000
is green-- a little bit from my
mother, and the one from my

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,036
mother has a little bit
from my father.

241
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:36,055
And this is really amazing
because it shows you that this

242
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:40,023
is so favorable for creating
variation in a population that

243
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:44,023
it has really become a formal
part of the meiosis process.

244
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:45,050
It happens so frequently.

245
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,012
This isn't just some random
fluke, and it happens in a

246
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,049
reasonably organized way.

247
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,084
It actually happens at a point
where it doesn't kind of

248
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:56,012
create junk genes.

249
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:59,066
Because you can imagine, this
cut-off point, which is called

250
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:02,069
a chiasma, it could have
happened in the middle of some

251
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,026
gene, and it could have created
some random noise, and

252
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,098
it could have broken down some
protein development in the

253
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,000
future or who knows what.

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,096
But it doesn't happen
that way.

255
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:12,036
It happens in a reasonably
organized way, which kind of

256
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:15,071
speaks to the idea that it's
part of the process.

257
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,097
So prophase in I, you also
have this happening.

258
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:21,021
So once that happens you could
have this guy's got a little

259
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:26,080
bit of that chromatid and then
this guy's got a little bit of

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,035
that chromatid.

261
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,070
So all of this stuff happens
in prophase I.

262
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,054
You have this crossing over.

263
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:36,088
The nuclear envelope starts to
disassemble, and then all of

264
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,046
these guys align and the
chromatin starts forming into

265
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:42,099
these more tightly wound
structures of chromosomes.

266
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:45,084
And really, that's all-- when
we talk about even mitosis,

267
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:48,000
that's where a lot of the action
really took place.

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,001
Once that happens, then we're
ready to enter into the

269
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,091
metaphase I, so let's go
down to metaphase I.

270
00:12:54,091 --> 00:13:00,010
In metaphase I-- let me just
copy and paste what I've

271
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,071
already done-- the nuclear
envelope is now gone.

272
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:09,074


273
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:12,082
The centrosomes have
gone to opposite

274
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:17,012
sides of the cell itself.

275
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,000
Maybe I should draw the
entire cell now

276
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,002
that there's no nucleus.

277
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,009
Let me erase the nucleus
a little bit

278
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,099
better than I've done.

279
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:30,007
Let me erase all of that.

280
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:34,046
And, of course, we have the
spindles fibers that have been

281
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:39,075
generated by now with the
help of the centrosomes.

282
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,094
And some of them, as we learned,
this is exactly what

283
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:44,030
happened in mitosis.

284
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,028
They attach to the kinetochores,
which are

285
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:52,054
attached to the centromeres
of these chromosomes.

286
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:55,097
Now, what's interesting here is
that they each attach-- so

287
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:59,050
this guy's going to attach to--
and actually, let me do

288
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,095
something interesting here.

289
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:02,076
Instead of doing it this way,
because I want to show that

290
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,007
all my dad's chromosomes don't
go to one side and all my

291
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:06,075
mom's chromosomes don't
go to the other side.

292
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:10,000
So instead of drawing these two
guys like this, let me see

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,030
if I can flip them.

294
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,087
Let me see.

295
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:15,014
Let me just flip them
the other way.

296
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,055
Whether or not which direction
they're flipped is completely

297
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:20,050
random, and that's what
adds to the variation.

298
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,054
As we said before, sexual
reproduction is key to

299
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:25,061
introducing variation
into a population.

300
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:28,020
So that's the mom's and
that's the dad's.

301
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,078
They don't have to.

302
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,070
All of the ones from my dad
might have ended up on one

303
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,029
side and all of them from my mom
might end up on one side,

304
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,049
although when you're talking
about 23 pairs, the

305
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,072
probability becomes
a lot, lot lower.

306
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:41,055
So this is one from my dad.

307
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:44,092
Of course, it has some
centromeres.

308
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,078
Let me draw that there.

309
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,015
And so these microspindles,
some of them attach to

310
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,048
kinetochores, which are these
protein structures on the

311
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:54,055
centromeres.

312
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:57,010
And this is just
like metaphase.

313
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,004
It's very similar to metaphase
in mitosis.

314
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:05,015
This is called metaphase I,
and everything aligns.

315
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:08,040
Now we're going to
enter anaphase I.

316
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,004
Now, anaphase I is interesting,
because remember,

317
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:16,071
in mitosis in anaphase, the
actual chromatids, the sister

318
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:18,087
chromatids separated
from each other.

319
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:22,099
That's not the case in anaphase
I here in meiosis.

320
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:28,001
So when we enter anaphase I, you
have just the homologous

321
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,084
pairs separate, so the
chromatids stay with their

322
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,062
sister chromatids.

323
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:37,012
So on this side, you'll have
these to go there.

324
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:42,062
While I have the green out, let
me see if I can draw this

325
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:45,007
respectably.

326
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:46,077
I have the purple.

327
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:49,077
It's a little bit shorter
version here.

328
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:53,048
He's got a little bit of
a stub of green there.

329
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:56,017
This guy's got little stub
of purple there.

330
00:15:56,017 --> 00:16:00,000
And then they have this longer
purple chromosome here.

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,050
This is anaphase I.

332
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,028
They're being pulled apart,
but they're being pulled

333
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,025
apart-- the homologous pair is
being pulled apart, not the

334
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:10,061
actual chromosomes, not
the chromatids.

335
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:13,023
So let me just draw this.

336
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:14,089
So then you have your
microtubules.

337
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,005
Some are connected to
these kinetochores.

338
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,030
You have your centromeres.

339
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,077


340
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,063
Of course, all of this is
occurring within the cell and

341
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,057
these are getting
pulled apart.

342
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:28,009
So it's analogous to anaphase
in mitosis, but the key

343
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,083
difference is you're pulling
apart homologous pairs.

344
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,007
You're not actually splitting
the chromosomes into their

345
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:37,024
constituent chromatids,
and that's key.

346
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:40,029
And if you forget that, you can
review the mitosis video.

347
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:41,084
So this is anaphase I.

348
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:48,039


349
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,005
And then as you could imagine,
telophase I is essentially

350
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:57,099
once these guys are at their
respective ends of the cell--

351
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,019
it's getting tiring redrawing
all of these, but I guess it

352
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,004
gives you time to let
it all sink in.

353
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:09,024
So these guys are now at the
left end of the cell and these

354
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:15,049
guys are now at the right
end of the cell.

355
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,009
Now, the microtubules start
to disassemble.

356
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,010
So maybe they're there a
little bit, but they're

357
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,079
disassembling.

358
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,017
You still have your centromeres
here and they're

359
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,038
at opposite poles.

360
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,033
And to some degree, in the
early part of telophase,

361
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,086
they're still pushing the cell
apart, and at the same time,

362
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:32,050
you have cytokinesis
happening.

363
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:38,002
So by the end of telophase I,
you have the actual cytoplasm

364
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:42,048
splitting during telophase right
there, and the nuclear

365
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,080
envelope is forming.

366
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,064
You can almost view it as the
opposite of prophase.

367
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:50,001


368
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,029
The nuclear envelope is forming,
and by the end of

369
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,052
telophase I, it will have
completely divided.

370
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:58,002
So this is telophase I.

371
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:02,071
Now, notice: we started off with
a diploid cell, right?

372
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:07,060
It had two pairs of homologous
chromosome, but it had four

373
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,030
chromosomes.

374
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,032
Now, each cell only has
two chromosomes.

375
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:18,078
Essentially, each cell got one
of the pair of each of those

376
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,096
homologous pairs, but it was
done randomly, and that's

377
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:23,069
where a lot of the variation
is introduced.

378
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,068
Now, once we're at this stage,
each of these cells now

379
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:29,031
undergo meiosis II,
which is actually

380
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:32,053
very similar to mitosis.

381
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,054
And sometimes, there's actually
an in-between stage

382
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:37,050
called interphase II, where
the cell kind of rests and

383
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,078
whatever else, and actually the
centromeres now have to

384
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,056
duplicate again.

385
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:44,060
So these two cells-- I've drawn
them separately-- let's

386
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,009
see what happens next.

387
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,042
So let's say that the
centromere-- actually, I

388
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,081
shouldn't have drawn the
centromere inside the

389
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,074
nucleus like that.

390
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:55,035
The centromere's going to be
outside the nucleus, outside

391
00:18:55,035 --> 00:19:00,088
of the newly formed nucleus
there and there.

392
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:04,031
And then it'll actually
replicate itself at

393
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,045
this point as well.

394
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,070
So now we have two cells.

395
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,047


396
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:17,090
Let me just cut and paste what
I have. I have this one, this

397
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,038
chromosome right here.

398
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:22,065
It's got this little green stub
there and then I have

399
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:25,063
this longer fully green
chromosome there.

400
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:32,035
Now, this guy, he's got this
little purple stub here.

401
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:35,076
Let me draw this whole purple
chromosome there.

402
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:39,050
Then this guy has one chromatid
like that and one

403
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,036
chromatid like that.

404
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:47,005
Now, when we enter prophase
II, what do you

405
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,060
think is going to happen?

406
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,082
Well, just like before, you
have your nuclear envelope

407
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:56,008
that formed in telophase I.

408
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,082
It's kind of a temporary
thing.

409
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:59,047
It starts to disintegrate
again.

410
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:06,032


411
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:10,051
And then you have your
centromeres.

412
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,054
They start pushing apart so
now I had two centromeres.

413
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:17,028
They replicated, and now they
start pushing apart while they

414
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:19,025
generate their little
spindles.

415
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,083
They push apart in opposite
directions.

416
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,052
Now, this is happening in
two cells, of course.

417
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:26,028
They go in opposite directions
while they generate their

418
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,001
spindle fibers.

419
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,030
And let me make it very clear
that this is two cells we're

420
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,068
talking about.

421
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:35,018
That's one of them and that's
the second of them.

422
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:42,085
Now it's going to enter
metaphase II, which is

423
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:45,092
analogous to metaphase I, or
metaphase in mitosis, where

424
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:48,004
the chromosomes get lined up.

425
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:49,004
Let me draw it this way.

426
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:52,048
So now the centromeres, they've
migrated to the two

427
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:54,080
poles of the cell.

428
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,076
So those are my centromeres.

429
00:20:57,076 --> 00:21:00,008
I have all of my spindles
fibers.

430
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:05,023


431
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,063
Oh, sorry, did I call
those centromeres?

432
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:07,088
The centrosomes.

433
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:10,019


434
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,065
I don't know how long I've been
calling them centromeres.

435
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:14,082
These are centrosomes, and my
brain keeps confusing them.

436
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:17,035
The centromeres, and maybe
this'll help you not do what I

437
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:20,051
just did, the centromeres are
the things that are connecting

438
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,008
the two sister chromatids.

439
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,006
Those are centromeres.

440
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:26,080
Centrosomes are the things that
are pushing back the--

441
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,045
that generate the
spindle fibers.

442
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,050
The chromosomes line up
during metaphase.

443
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,020
Metaphase always involves the
lining up of chromosomes so

444
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,078
that one-- let me
just draw it.

445
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:38,078
So I have that and that.

446
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:41,081
This one's got a purple
guy, too.

447
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:44,092
This guy's got a purple guy,
a long purple guy, and then

448
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,088
there's a little stub
for the other guy.

449
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:51,041
This guy's got a long green
guy and this guy's got a

450
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:56,053
little green stub, and then this
is the short green guy

451
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,022
right there.

452
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,065
And, of course, they're
being aligned.

453
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:01,026
Some of these spindle fibers
have been attached to the

454
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:03,035
centromeres or the kinetochores
that are on the

455
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:08,046
centromeres that connect these
two chromatids, these sister

456
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:09,065
chromatids.

457
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:11,081
And, of course, we don't have
a nuclear membrane anymore,

458
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,082
and these are, of course,
two separate cells.

459
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,074
And then you can guess what
happens in anaphase II.

460
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:19,097
It's just like anaphase
in mitosis.

461
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:24,021


462
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:27,033
These things get pulled apart
by the kinetochore

463
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,019
microtubules, while the other
microtubules keep growing and

464
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,014
push and these two things
further apart.

465
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,048
So let me show that.

466
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,052
And they the key here: this
is the difference between

467
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:37,097
anaphase II and anaphase I.

468
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:42,096
Anaphase I, the homologous pairs
were broken up, but the

469
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:45,028
chromosomes themselves
were not.

470
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:48,011
Now, in anaphase II, we don't
have homologous pairs.

471
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:51,027
We just have chromatid pairs,
sister chromatids.

472
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:54,091
Now, those are separated,
which is very similar to

473
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:57,007
anaphase in mitosis.

474
00:22:57,007 --> 00:23:00,020
So now, this guy gets pulled in
that direction so it look

475
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,094
something like this.

476
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:04,082
The drawing here is the hardest
part of this video.

477
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,020
So that guy gets pulled there.

478
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,056
That guy's getting pulled
in that direction.

479
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:10,083
He's got that little
green stub on him.

480
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,047
And then you have one green
guy getting pulled in that

481
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,021
direction with the longer
chromosome.

482
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,022
And then one of the other longer
is getting pulled in

483
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,019
that direction, and it's all
by these microtubules

484
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:25,067
connected at the kinetochore
structures by a centrosome as

485
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:28,084
kind of the coordinating body.

486
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:30,034
It's all being pulled apart.

487
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,084
Anaphase has always involved
the pulling apart of the

488
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:36,044
chromosomes or pulling
apart of something.

489
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:37,029
Let me put it that way.

490
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,010
And it's happening on this
side of the cell as well.

491
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,082
Of course, this is
all one cell.

492
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:49,048
And just like in mitosis, as
soon as the sister chromatids

493
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:52,045
are split apart, they are now
referred to as chromosomes, or

494
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:53,091
sister chromosomes.

495
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,052
And, of course, this
is happening twice.

496
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:59,069
This is also happening
in the other cell.

497
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:01,000
The other cell's a little
bit cleaner.

498
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,073
It didn't have that
crossover occur.

499
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:08,090
So you have the longer
purple one.

500
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,059
He gets split up into two
chromatids, which we are now

501
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,081
calling chromosomes, or
sister chromosomes.

502
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:19,052
And then this guy up here, he
gets split up into this short

503
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:23,026
green, and then there's a-- let
me do it this way-- this

504
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,081
short green, and he's
got a little purple

505
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,049
stub on it right there.

506
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,008
And, of course, it's all being
pulled away by the same idea,

507
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:30,088
by the centrosomes.

508
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:33,070
I want to make sure I
get that word right.

509
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,031
I'm afraid whether I used
centromeres for the whole

510
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:39,010
first part of the video, but
hopefully, my confusion will

511
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,053
help you from getting confused
because you'll realize that

512
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:44,058
it's a pitfall to fall into.

513
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,038
So that's anaphase.

514
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:46,078
Everything is getting
pulled apart.

515
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:49,080
And then you can imagine
what telophase II is.

516
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,003
In fact, I won't
even redraw it.

517
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:55,000
Telophase II, these things get
pulled apart even more, so

518
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,017
this is telophase II.

519
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:00,042
They get pulled apart
even more.

520
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,018
The cell elongates.

521
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:09,018
You start having this cleavage
occur right here.

522
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:11,034
So at the same time that in
telophase II these get pulled

523
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,055
part, you have the
cytokinesis.

524
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,044
The tubules start disintegrating
and then you

525
00:25:15,044 --> 00:25:19,088
have a nucleus that forms
around these.

526
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:22,072
So what is the end result
of all of these?

527
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:29,027
Well, that guy's going to turn
into a nucleus that has this

528
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,058
purple dude with a little green
stub, and then a long

529
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:38,046
green guy, and then he's got
his nuclear membrane.

530
00:25:38,046 --> 00:25:41,061
And, of course, there's the
entire cytoplasm in the rest

531
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:43,029
of the cell.

532
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:46,027
The other person that was his
kind of partner in this

533
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:50,018
meiosis II, he's going
to have a short

534
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:55,098
purple and a long green.

535
00:25:55,098 --> 00:26:00,060
He has a nuclear membrane,
and, of course, it has

536
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,033
cytoplasm around it.

537
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,073
And then on this side, you have

538
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:05,095
something similar happening.

539
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:10,029
You see this first guy, this
first one right here has two

540
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,083
long purple ones.

541
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,007
They get separated.

542
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,088
So let me see, you have one long
purple in that cell and

543
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:19,067
you have another long
purple in this cell.

544
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,077
In that top one, you have a
short green one, and in this

545
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:25,025
bottom, you have a short green
one that had got a little bit

546
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:28,096
of one of my dad's-- a
homologous part of one of my

547
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,051
dad's chromosomes on it.

548
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:33,074
And, of course, these also
have nuclear membranes,

549
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:37,063
nuclear membranes, and, of
course, it has a cytoplasm in

550
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,090
the rest of the cell, which
we'll learn more about all

551
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,010
those other things.

552
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,090
So what we see here is that we
went from a diploid starting

553
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,052
way-- where did we start?

554
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:50,089
We started up here with a
diploid germ cell, and we went

555
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,081
through two stages
of division.

556
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:56,022
The first stage split up
homologous pairs, but it

557
00:26:56,022 --> 00:26:58,058
started over with that crossing
over, that genetic

558
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,038
combination, which is a key
feature of meiosis, which adds

559
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,061
a lot a variation to a species
or to a gene pool.

560
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:08,007
And then the second phase
separated the sister

561
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:11,095
chromatids, just like what
happens in mitosis.

562
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:15,098
And we end up with four haploid
cells because they

563
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:18,075
have half the contingency of
chromosomes, and these are

564
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:20,000
called gametes.

565
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,049

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,065


2
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:08,016
The whole point of the immune
system is to keep out shady

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,094
things from your body-- or, if
they get in, to kill them.

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:15,067
So those shady things would
include shady proteins that

5
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:23,067
can do damage to your body,
viruses, bacteria, even

6
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:31,028
eukaryotic parasites,
and then even fungi.

7
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,077
So all sorts of things that if
they were to enter your body,

8
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:37,004
they would cause some
form of disease.

9
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,050
These are collectively
called pathogens.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,072


11
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:44,061
So the whole point of the immune
system is, on a first

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:47,071
line of defense, keep these
things out-- and then if they

13
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:51,047
were to get into your body, to
kill and eliminate them from

14
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:53,045
our system so that we don't
get sick and so

15
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:54,096
that we don't die.

16
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,046
So I already just mentioned that
there's kind of two lines

17
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:59,050
of defense and even with
those, there's kind of

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,034
subclassifications.

19
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:03,079
The first line of defense-- I'll
just call that the first

20
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:10,014
line-- which is essentially just
to keep things out-- keep

21
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,093
all of these pathogens out.

22
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:14,026
And there's some obvious ones.

23
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,040
There's our skin.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,054
Our skin keeps pathogens out and
actually even the oils on

25
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,004
our skin are a little bit more
acidic and it's hard for some

26
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:27,040
types of bacteria to thrive in
that type of environment.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,032
You have your mucus membranes
and in the mucus, there's

28
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:37,054
there's some chemicals that
maybe make it a little bit

29
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:40,031
more difficult for bacteria
to survive.

30
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,064
And then you even have acidic
environments like

31
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:44,089
your stomach acid.

32
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:48,000


33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,012
You might not view your stomach
as the outside of you,

34
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,031
but it fundamentally is.

35
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:55,081
Your whole digestive tract,
which I'll make videos on in

36
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,084
the near future, is really
on the outside of you.

37
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:04,012
You can simply model really most
vertebrate bodies as kind

38
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:07,026
of a doughnut our digestive
tract is the

39
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,028
inside of the doughnut.

40
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:14,002
So stomach acid is on the
outside of our real bodies and

41
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:16,087
you can imagine, that's a hard
environment for a lot of these

42
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,056
pathogens to survive in.

43
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,071
So that's the first line of
defense, but we know that

44
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:24,081
that's not good enough, that
sometimes these things can get

45
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:27,075
into our bodies, and there we
have to start thinking about

46
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,075
the second line of defense.

47
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:33,053
What do we do once things are
actually in our body?

48
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:44,097


49
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:48,055
And here, in both the first and
second line, I'm talking

50
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:51,065
about non-specific immunity--
and this is going to make a

51
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:54,028
lot of sense when we start
talking about specific

52
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:54,084
immunities.

53
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:57,002
So both of these are
non-specific.

54
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:00,062


55
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:03,084
And when I say non-specific--
or you can also call them

56
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:09,043
innate-- it means that they
just generally respond to

57
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,005
things that appear bad.

58
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:13,084
They don't remember the bad
things that came before.

59
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:16,068
They don't respond to a
particular type of virus or a

60
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:20,006
particular-- well, they do
respond to every type of virus

61
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:23,027
or every type of bacteria, but
they don't say, this is virus

62
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:26,065
type A, B, C, or this is
bacteria type A, B, C.

63
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,099
They just say, this
is a virus.

64
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,012
Let me get rid of it, or
let me not let it in.

65
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:31,018
This is a bacteria.

66
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:33,038
Let me get rid of it or
let me not let it in.

67
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:36,094
It doesn't know what type of
bacteria it's dealing with.

68
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:39,031
So this is all the
non-specific or

69
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,062
innate immune system.

70
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:44,037
And we'll go into a lot of
detail on the specific immune

71
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,084
system because you can imagine,
it becomes very

72
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,075
complicated or interesting when
you start thinking about

73
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:51,071
your body somehow remembering a
virus that it's seen before

74
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,093
and being able to respond better
to that virus or that

75
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:57,024
bacteria or that protein the
second time it sees it.

76
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,058
So we're dealing with
non-specific in this case.

77
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:04,008
And the the second line of your
non-specific immunity,

78
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:04,078
there are two things.

79
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,075
One is an inflammatory
response.

80
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:16,091


81
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:20,025
And I'm going to do a whole
video on this, but in general,

82
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:23,011
we've all experienced
inflammatory responses.

83
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,000
When you see blood flowing to a
certain part of an area and

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you see there's pus and
there's-- and I'm going to go

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,027
into a lot more detail on what
an inflammatory response

86
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:33,008
actually is, but that's one of
your-- and what it really is

87
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:37,025
doing is bringing blood and
bringing cells that can fight

88
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:41,044
whatever type of infection you
have. It's bringing them to

89
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:45,002
the site where maybe you got a
cut or maybe where a lot of

90
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,037
the bacteria or whatever
the pathogen is.

91
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,081
So inflammatory response is all
about bringing fluid and

92
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,056
fighters to the fight.

93
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:55,020


94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,050
I'm going to do a whole
video on that.

95
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:07,018


96
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:10,006
But the byproduct is, that part
of your tissue or that

97
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,002
part of you body gets inflamed--
a lot of fluid

98
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:16,095
there, a lot of byproducts of
the battle that goes on there.

99
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll do a whole
video on that.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,010
And the other second line of
defense is, and it's actually

101
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,093
part of the inflammatory
response-- are phagocytosis or

102
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,018
phagocytes.

103
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,073


104
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:31,012
And really, what I want to do
over the rest of this video is

105
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:34,030
talk in a little bit more
detail about phagocytes

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,011
because once we understand what
phagocytes do, that's a

107
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:42,035
pretty good building block for
going into the specific immune

108
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,000
system-- and actually, it'll
help lead into the discussion

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,085
on the inflammatory response as
well because phagocytes are

110
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:51,074
really part of the inflammatory
response.

111
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:54,045
So phagocytes are just
a class of cell

112
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,043
that can eat up pathogens.

113
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,001
They can eat up other things
really, but when we talk about

114
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,097
the immune system, we're talking
about pathogens.

115
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:04,070
So let's say that this is
a phagocyte right here.

116
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,062
This is a phagocyte
right there.

117
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,031
It has some kind of a
nucleus, whatever.

118
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:12,055
I don't have to focus on the
inside of the phagocyte.

119
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:16,020
It's a traditional eukaryotic
cell, but what I want to do is

120
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,083
see what happens when a
phagocyte encounters a foreign

121
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,058
particle or a foreign
bacteria.

122
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:26,085
So let me say this is a foreign
bacteria right here.

123
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,093
So the phagocyte, we've already
said, is non-specific.

124
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:32,062
What it does is, it has
receptors that respond to just

125
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:34,037
things that it knows are bad.

126
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:36,042
You could imagine these
are super sensors.

127
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:43,005


128
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,041
Maybe these are super sensors
for bacteria.

129
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,000
The bacteria have proteins on
their surface that maybe look

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,086
something like that.

131
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,026
Obviously they don't look
exactly like that.

132
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:53,024
I'm just drawing them as kind
of a Y and a triangle so you

133
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:54,043
can see that they fit.

134
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:59,081
But once these two guys
connect-- let me draw the

135
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:02,010
situation where they
have connected.

136
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,031
So this is the bacteria.

137
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,060
This is the pathogen.

138
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,067
And it's really the same idea
with a virus or any

139
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,060
other type of thing.

140
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,006
And we'll actually see in future
videos that these guys

141
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:13,025
can actually be tagged by other
molecules, which makes

142
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:17,010
these phagocytes want to
attack them even more.

143
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,072
Once they're bonded--
that's my bacteria,

144
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,089
the invading pathogen.

145
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:25,058
And now it is bonded.

146
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:28,085
It has triggered the receptor
on this phagocyte.

147
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:34,054
This phagocyte will start to
engulf-- it'll wrap around

148
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,079
this pathogen.

149
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:44,013


150
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:48,012
And these two ends are
eventually going to meet.

151
00:07:48,012 --> 00:08:00,023


152
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:03,068
But then once these two meet,
what's it going to look like?

153
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:09,031
Then all of a sudden, that
bacteria is going to be

154
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,035
completely engulfed.

155
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,087
It's going to be inside
of the cell.

156
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:15,075
So now the cell-- once these
two ends meet and these

157
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:19,006
membranes merge, then this guy
is going to be in his own

158
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:21,041
little membrane bubble-- or you
can almost imagine, it's

159
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,081
in its own little vesicle.

160
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:28,037
So this is the pathogen, the
bacteria in this case-- but

161
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:31,094
phagocytosis-- the process is
completely identical in terms

162
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,034
of how it engulfs things.

163
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:37,038
If it was a virus or some type
of other foreign protein or

164
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,000
any type of really foreign
molecule-- actually, sometimes

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,062
it doesn't even occur
to foreign stuff.

166
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:47,077
It can occur to dying molecules
that are not

167
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:49,030
foreign, that just need
to be cleared out.

168
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,019
But we'll just focus on the
immune system, on foreign

169
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,044
things right now.

170
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:54,087


171
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:58,092
So this membrane right here will
completely merge and go

172
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:01,051
around this guy like this.

173
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,079
And of course, you had your
receptors and who knows if

174
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,090
they're still there.

175
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,074
By the time-- let's just draw
them there so you see that

176
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:08,079
that part is that part.

177
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,022
But once it's fully engulfed,
this thing is called a

178
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:20,024
phagosome, on which is really
just a vesicle that contains

179
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,074
that foreign particle that
you want to get rid of.

180
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:33,065
And then other fluid or vesicles
that contain things

181
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:38,079
that can eat up this phagosome--
so let's say that

182
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,036
this is some vesicle that
contains things-- lysozymes

183
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:46,090
and it contains really reactive
species of oxygen.

184
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,041


185
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,091
And if this comes in contact
with, really, almost any

186
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,024
biological compound, it's
going to do some damage.

187
00:09:55,024 --> 00:10:00,036
But once the pathogen is
completely merged inside the

188
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:06,052
cell, this little package will
merge over here and it will

189
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:11,012
dump its contents into this
phagosome, into this vesicle

190
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:15,037
containing the pathogen,
and then break it up.

191
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:18,099
It's essentially digesting it.

192
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,019
So obviously the first role is,
it just got it out of the

193
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,052
way and it killed it.

194
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,090
And then the second role-- and
I'm just going to give a

195
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,023
little tidbit right here.

196
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:28,065
We're going to do it in a lot
more detail in future videos.

197
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:29,090
It breaks it up.

198
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:38,049


199
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,054
So now the thing is
all broken up.

200
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:45,033


201
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:48,092
So that thing is broken up into
constituent proteins and

202
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,059
another molecules.

203
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:57,054
And then what the phagocyte
does-- it'll actually take

204
00:10:57,054 --> 00:11:02,004
some subset of these
molecules, some

205
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:02,099
subset of the proteins.

206
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,016
It'll break them out.

207
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,086
Proteins are just sequences
of amino acids.

208
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,035
Normally when people say
proteins, they're talking

209
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,058
about long sequences
of amino acids.

210
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:13,075
When people talk about short
sequences of amino acids or a

211
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:16,082
protein that's broken up a lot,
they refer to it as a

212
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,071
peptide chain.

213
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:20,036
A peptide chain is a shorter
chain of amino acids.

214
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,087
So this guy will take some
special peptide chains, some

215
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:28,015
special pieces from the thing it
just killed, attach them to

216
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,091
some other proteins.

217
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:37,001
So it'll take maybe a little
piece of this bacteria right

218
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:45,005
now, attach it to other protein,
which is called a

219
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,079
major histocompatibility
complex-- and if we're talking

220
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,064
about phagocytes, this will be
a major histocompatibility

221
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:54,013
complex type II.

222
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:59,080


223
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,089
It sounds very-- a strange word,
but we're going to see

224
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,014
this a lot.

225
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:17,011


226
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:20,011
So they abbreviate it MHC.

227
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:24,058
This is a protein and it bonds
with this peptide that was

228
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:27,050
kind of chunked off or digested
off of this invading

229
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,082
pathogen and then this phagocyte
will then present it

230
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,090
onto its membrane.

231
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,059
So this combination-- the
complex of the MHC-- in this

232
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,041
case, it's going to be
an MHC II protein.

233
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,096


234
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,082
We're going to talk about
Type II in the future.

235
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:49,091
It's going to take this complex
and then present it on

236
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,016
its surface.

237
00:12:51,016 --> 00:13:01,077


238
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:05,005
And the reason why I'm going
through all this pain of

239
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,092
explaining this process-- you're
like, hey, we already

240
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:08,034
got rid of the thing
and killed it.

241
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,024
Why is Sal worried about what
we do with the peptides?

242
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,077
This is crucial to our immune
system because we'll see other

243
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:16,059
specific parts of our
immune system.

244
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,059
Remember, so far everything
is non-specific.

245
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,028
This guy just said, this
is an invader.

246
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:22,089
It doesn't know the type
of an invader.

247
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,089
It just says, hey, let me bond
to this thing and kill it.

248
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,026
It's one of these things that I
know are foreign to my body.

249
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:33,087
So it kills it, but now it can
leave it on its surface and

250
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:36,046
now the specific parts, the
parts that actually have

251
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:40,045
memory and attack specific
things, can say, gee, Mr.

252
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:42,060
Phagocyte, look, you've
killed something.

253
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,025
Let me see if I have some
specific reactions that can be

254
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,041
triggered by this thing that
you're presenting.

255
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,000
So, many phagocytes
are also called

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,059
antigen presenting cells.

257
00:13:52,059 --> 00:14:00,012


258
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:03,025
And I'm going to go into more
detail on what exactly an

259
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,063
antigen is.

260
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,034
I called this thing
a pathogen.

261
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:10,095
An antigen is essentially-- you
can view it as a protein

262
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:15,075
or a peptide chain that will
trigger or that can be dealt

263
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,083
with within the immune system.

264
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,072
I'll be a little bit-- the
specific immune system.

265
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,016
And I'm going to be a little bit
more nuanced about it when

266
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:24,014
I talk-- I'll make a whole
video on antigens and

267
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:27,080
antibodies, but right now you
can just view it as a peptide

268
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,062
chain right there.

269
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:31,065
An antigen is just a protein
or part of a protein.

270
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:34,038
So this is presenting an antigen
on its surface that

271
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:37,022
can later be used
by other parts.

272
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:41,072
Now, the one thing that-- there
are many, many types of

273
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,047
phagocytes.

274
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,029
And just to give you-- just so
when you see different words,

275
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,025
you don't get confused by the
different types of phagocytes.

276
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,086
I'll do a little review
of those right now.

277
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:52,011
You have neutrophils.

278
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,085


279
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:58,034
These are actually the most
common of the phagocytes.

280
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:01,012
And these are the fast and
numerous respondors.

281
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:10,087
So these get to a location
of infection very fast.

282
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:13,089
Phagocytes don't necessarily
just have to kill in this way.

283
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:15,062
I mean, they're called
phagocytes because they engulf

284
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,092
this way, but we'll in future
videos talk about other ways

285
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:20,084
that they can release chemicals
or even DNA nets to

286
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:23,053
ensnare pathogens,
but neutrophils

287
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,021
are fast and abundant.

288
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:30,061
And then you have macrophages,
which are-- on some level,

289
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,079
they're the most versatile and
do the heavy lifting, but

290
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,055
they're also phagocytes.

291
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:38,012
And then you dendritic cells.

292
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,046
And when you first see the
word dendritic cell, you

293
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,051
think, hey, does this somehow
relate to dendrites of the

294
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,038
nervous system?

295
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:46,074
And no, they have nothing to
do with the nervous system.

296
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:52,072


297
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,010
The reason why they're called
dendritic cells is because

298
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,035
they look like they
have dendrites.

299
00:15:55,035 --> 00:16:03,019


300
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,063
So they look like neurons on
some level, but they don't

301
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:08,012
participate in the nervous
system at all.

302
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,061
And these tend to be the best
activators of the specific

303
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,091
immune system that we'll talk
about in future videos.

304
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,067
So anyway, I'll leave you there
and we'll talk more

305
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:19,069
about all of this in the
next few videos.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,068


2
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:02,000
I want to review a little
bit of what we

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,070
did in the last video.

4
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,051
And maybe draw a larger, more
spread-out diagram.

5
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:08,056
Because I think in the last
video I started to cram things

6
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,006
on the right-hand side here.

7
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,017
And this is a very important
concept, so I want to do it

8
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:14,065
nice and spread-out in a way
that we can breathe.

9
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:17,085
And maybe in the process I can
fill in some more blanks.

10
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:22,039
So let's go back and draw the
membrane of a thylakoid that's

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,021
sitting inside of a chloroplast.
I'm going to draw

12
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:26,022
this same membrane here.

13
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:30,044
So let me draw it nice
and spread out.

14
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:35,009
So let me draw a nice big
membrane like that.

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,052
That's the inside
of the membrane.

16
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:39,078
So you can imagine that this
loops around and that would

17
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:41,050
form the thylakoid.

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,063
On this side of the membrane
we have the lumen.

19
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:47,011
And on the outside of the
membrane we have the stroma,

20
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:50,084
where all the fluid that fills
up the choloroplast. So this

21
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:54,088
is the stroma right there.

22
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:57,082
And this is just a kind of
standard membrane that we see

23
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,000
in a lot of organelles.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,050
But this is actually a membrane
within an organelle.

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,087
And then maybe there will be
a phospho-bilipid layer.

26
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:08,084
And I just say that, or I'm
pointing that out because I

27
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:10,095
want to think a little bit
about, in this video, how

28
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:13,023
protons can actually get
across this thing.

29
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:16,076
How do we use the energy from
these electrons going to lower

30
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:21,078
energy states to actually pump
protons across this membrane.

31
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:24,037
So you know when you have these
bilipid layers, your

32
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:26,051
outside is hydrophilic.

33
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,056
And of course, it's hydrophilic
because it

34
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,007
operates well in a polar
environment.

35
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,034
And then the insides are
non-polar or they're

36
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,087
hydrophobic and you
have these tales.

37
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:38,051
So I could draw the whole
membrane like that, but I

38
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:38,099
won't do that.

39
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,056
It will take me forever.

40
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,006
But let me draw some of the
components that I did in the

41
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:43,068
last video.

42
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:45,040
So we have these complexes that

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,059
span across this membrane.

44
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:50,079
And the place we started
off with was the

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,037
photosystem II complex.

46
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:56,017


47
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:59,065
And then later on we have the
photosystem I complex.

48
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:04,037


49
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:09,069
And let me draw the ATP
synthase right here.

50
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,033
So ATP synthase also
spans across it.

51
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,006
Then it has little
motor part of it.

52
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:17,075
And the hydrogens go through and
it spins the motor and it

53
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:21,028
crams the phosphate groups
into the ADP to make ATP.

54
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:23,015
I'll talk about that
in a second.

55
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:25,088
But the first thing I want to
point out is, as I said in the

56
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:29,037
last video, the first place
where the electrons get

57
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:33,071
excited is in the chlorophyll
and photosystem II.

58
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,059
And then it gets less and less
and less excited, it gets

59
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:40,015
headed off from one complex
to another complex.

60
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,012
And eventually ends up
in photosystem I.

61
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,078
It gets excited again.

62
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:46,009
Then it gets handed off, handed
off, the whole time

63
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,088
that energy is being used to
transfer hydrogen protons from

64
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:56,080
the stroma into the lumen .

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,015
But the first question that I
would ask is, why is this

66
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:03,071
called photosystem II, while
this is called photosystem I

67
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,059
when we're starting over here?

68
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:10,078
And the reason is, this was
discovered first. Even though

69
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:14,052
in the light reaction it
actually comes into use, or it

70
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,075
comes into play, second.

71
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:18,078
This was discovered first.
That's why they call it

72
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:19,096
photosystem I.

73
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:22,088
But the reality is photosystem
II is where

74
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,080
everything starts from.

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,090
Now in some textbooks you'll
also see this written as P680.

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,041
And you'll see photosystem
I written as P700.

77
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:38,000
And these numbers come from the
wavelength of light that

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,009
is best absorbed by the
chlorophyll in these

79
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:47,059
photosystems. So 680 corresponds
to 680 nanometers.

80
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:50,049
That's the wavelength of light
that this absorbs the best.

81
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,038
700 corresponds to
700 nanometers.

82
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:56,071
That's the wavelength of
light it absorbs best.

83
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:00,072
Now what I want to do here is
draw a little diagram below

84
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,097
here to kind of talk
more about the

85
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,015
electron energy states.

86
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:06,075
I just kind of handwaved it a
little bit in the last video.

87
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,052
So I'm going to draw a
little diagram here.

88
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:11,043


89
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,053
And over here I'm going to write
the different things

90
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,002
that the electron can
be a part of.

91
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:18,093
So right now the electrons
can be part of H2O.

92
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:23,030
It could be part of
chlorophyll A.

93
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,050


94
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,018
It could be a part of-- I'll
talk more about this in a

95
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:37,054
little bit-- pheophytin And
then you have all of the

96
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,098
molecules or the complexes
it can become a part of.

97
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,006
I'll actually write
them down here.

98
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,076
So let me write.

99
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,010
I don't want to take
up too much space.

100
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:56,025
Plastoquinone and then there's
a cytochrome B6F complex.

101
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,050
I'll just write B6F.

102
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,026


103
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:02,051
Then you have plastocyanin .

104
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,037


105
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,061
I'll just write as PC.

106
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:09,026
You don't have to
memorize these.

107
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,002
You'll forget them in
a week if you do.

108
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,070
But unless you're studying
photosynthesis, then it might

109
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,064
make sense to memorize them.

110
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:19,056
And this is in photosystem II.

111
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,081
Then you have chlorophyll
in photosystem I.

112
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:27,070


113
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,037
And then you have some other,
you know you have ferredoxin

114
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:34,079
I'll just write FD for
ferredoxin Some other

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,063
molecules, you keep going and
then you have your eventual

116
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:41,064
electron acceptor NADP plus.

117
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:44,001
Which, once it accepts the
electron, becomes NADPH.

118
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,066


119
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:52,057
Now, electrons are very-- so
this is, if we go up that's a

120
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:55,006
high energy state, down it's
a low energy state.

121
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,093
So electrons are already
very comfortable.

122
00:05:56,093 --> 00:06:00,020


123
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,069
in water.

124
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,077
And in chlorophyll A they're
even more comfortable.

125
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,007
At least this is
how I view it.

126
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,066


127
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:11,012
But left to its own devices,
this electron will never leave

128
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,036
chlorophyll A.

129
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,014
But we know what happens.

130
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:17,081
A photon comes in from 93
million miles away.

131
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,025
You could imagine photons as
little light packets or you

132
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,012
could view it as a light
wave. Either way.

133
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:25,069
And it excites-- not necessarily
directly the

134
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,081
chlorophyll A.

135
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:30,082
It might excite other antenna
chlorophyll or

136
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:33,013
other pigment molecules.

137
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:35,086
And then through resonance
energy, you can imagine them

138
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,060
vibrating, and it eventually
will excite the

139
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,024
photophorylation A directly.

140
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,020
Or excite the electrons in
chlorophyll A directly.

141
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,052
And this dude right
here gets excited.

142
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:49,005
Let me do that in a
brighter color.

143
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,067
So it goes to a high
energy state.

144
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,001
So the electron here is in
a high energy state.

145
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,019
Ignore that lumen right there.

146
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,004
It has nothing to do
with this electron.

147
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,002
And then it goes-- and actually
when it goes to the

148
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,083
high energy state, maybe I
should draw it like this, it

149
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,087
actually shows up
in pheophytin.

150
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,072
That is the primary
electron acceptor.

151
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:10,062
And it's actually a chlorophyll
A molecule.

152
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,091
Actually, let me show you
what a chlorophyll A

153
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,068
molecule looks like.

154
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:17,006
This is what a chlorophyll
A molecule looks like.

155
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,058
In general, it has a
hydrocarbon tail.

156
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,083
You see that right here.

157
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:25,089


158
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,050
And it has a porphyrin ring.

159
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,070
Or porphyrin head, I guess
you could call it.

160
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,061


161
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,037
This little group right here
is called a porphyrin.

162
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:39,024


163
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,051
And right in the center of
it, you have a magnesium.

164
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:44,086
That green right there, that's
a magnesium ion.

165
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:48,062
And when the photon comes in or
when the resonance energy

166
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:51,051
comes in from some of the
antenna molecules, electrons

167
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,083
in the double bond sitting
here in the

168
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,087
porphyrin head get excited.

169
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,081
Those are the electrons that
we're talking about.

170
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,058
And they get excited.

171
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:04,080
And the first electron acceptor
is this pheophytin

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,002
that I just talked about.

173
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:06,075
Pheophytin.

174
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:09,082
It actually looks just like a
chlorophyll, but it has no

175
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,047
magnesium ion in the middle.

176
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:14,011
And maybe I'm getting a little
bit into the weeds a little

177
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:14,085
bit too much.

178
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,095
But the pheophytin, you actually
see in this diagram

179
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,025
right here.

180
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:20,016
It's part of this photosystem
complex.

181
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,093
So the electron, you can
imagine, jumping from the

182
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:26,008
chlorophyll to the pheophytin
that does not have that

183
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,038
magnesium in the center.

184
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,022
And when it sits in the
pheophytin it's at a very,

185
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,043
very, very, very, high
energy state.

186
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,035


187
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:36,033
And then it keeps being
transferred from the

188
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:36,087
pheophytin.

189
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:41,086
It goes to the plastoquinone So
maybe we go to a slightly

190
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,038
lower energy state here.

191
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,064
We keep using the electron
in green.

192
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:50,023
Then it keeps going to a
slightly lower energy state in

193
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:52,075
the cytochrome B6F complex.

194
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:55,021
And then you have the
plastocyanin complex, lower

195
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,061
energy state.

196
00:08:56,061 --> 00:09:02,042
And then eventually it goes into
photosystem I at an even

197
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,021
lower energy state.

198
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:05,055
Maybe slightly higher than the
energy state that it was

199
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:08,047
originally in the chlorophyll A
molecule in photosystem II.

200
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,035
Another photon or another set
of photons comes and hits

201
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,028
photosystem I.

202
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,077
Maybe its antenna molecules,
through resonance energy, that

203
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:17,052
excites the electron.

204
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:20,037
It might directly hit the
chlorophyll in photosystem in

205
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:23,000
its reaction center.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,050
And then this gets
excited again.

207
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,025


208
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:32,035
And so once again we have an
electron with a high potential

209
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:36,072
that can keep going to, from one
molecule to another as it

210
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,007
gets more and more
comfortable.

211
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:41,063
And this releases energy that
can drive the proton pump.

212
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:45,011
And it eventually ends
up in the NADPH.

213
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,012
At a fairly high level
of energy still.

214
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:50,058
This electron can still be
transferred to other things

215
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:51,050
and release energy.

216
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,061
And we'll see that when we
talk about the light

217
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:55,017
independent reactions.

218
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:58,000
Now the whole point of me
showing you this is, I wanted

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,080
to kind of depict graphically
that the electron is starting

220
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,000
off at a pretty low
energy state.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,042
And the only way this happens
is by energy from light.

222
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,013
This would not happen
on its own.

223
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:12,087
Going from a low energy state
to a higher energy state.

224
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,032
And I touched on in the last
video, you have this electron

225
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,040
going here and it gets
transferred from one molecule

226
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,014
to another.

227
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:21,009
Gets excited again, then keeps
going all the way, eventually

228
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:24,064
being accepted by the NAD
plus to become NADPH.

229
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:26,082
And you're like, where
did that H come from?

230
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,059
You could say, well that
H is a proton.

231
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,015
It gets that electron and then
they merge together and you

232
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,034
have NADPH.

233
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,004
But either way.

234
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,074
But the question is, what
replaces this electron?

235
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:38,005
And that's where that amazing
thing that I talked about in

236
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,041
the last video happens.

237
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,021
Water gets oxidized.

238
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:43,005
Oxidizing is losing electrons.

239
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,066
OIL RIG.

240
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:52,011
So water gets oxidized by
the water oxidation

241
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,088
on photosystem II.

242
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:58,021
And that electron ends up and
replaces the electron in the

243
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:58,083
chlorophyll.

244
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,090
So once again, that's an amazing
idea, that you're

245
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,073
oxidizing oxygen.

246
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:06,040
So the net effect of what
happens is, is you're using

247
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,061
energy, using this photon
energy right here, to

248
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:15,011
essentially strip electrons
off of water.

249
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:17,050
And as you know, when it's on
water it's spending most of

250
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,070
its time on the oxygen.

251
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,076
So it essentially strips
electrons off of oxygen and

252
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:24,071
put them in a higher energy
state and have

253
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:27,036
them end up on NADPH.

254
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:30,022
And in the process, it
had gone to an even

255
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,028
higher energy state.

256
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:35,020
And then as it goes down to
NADPH, you are pumping protons

257
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,042
across the membrane.

258
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,033
We learned in the last video,
through chemiosmosis,

259
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:43,047
eventually goes through the ATP
synthase channel, turns

260
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:47,067
around this part of this protein
complex or enzyme

261
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:51,046
complex and actually
generates ATP.

262
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:55,007
ATP from ADP and phosphate
groups.

263
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,074
And in the electron transport
chain video, when I talk about

264
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:02,067
cellular respiration, I give a
visual concept of how this

265
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,062
actually might happen.

266
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:06,047
How you could, as these go
through, you actually can jam

267
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:09,045
together the ATP and the ADP.

268
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:12,067
So that's another question in
my head is, we talk about

269
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,060
these electrons going from
one molecule to another.

270
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,077
But how does that actually
pump hydrogen through?

271
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:20,021
And I'm just going to do a very
gross oversimplification.

272
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,007
I'm sure it's much more
complicated in

273
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,047
actual plant cells.

274
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:31,013
But you could imagine that we
have our pheophytin right here

275
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:33,075
that has that electron
on it right there.

276
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:35,039
Maybe it has its electron
right there.

277
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,042
This is a gross
oversimplification.

278
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,012
And then you have your
plastoquinone right here.

279
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,094


280
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,051
That's the next acceptor.

281
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:49,001
Now maybe on this protein
complex right there, the point

282
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,035
that wants to accept the
electron is right there.

283
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:57,097
And let's say that there's
another point on it that can

284
00:12:57,097 --> 00:13:00,016
accept a hydrogen.

285
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:03,016
Maybe it accepts a hydrogen
proton there.

286
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,090
So you can imagine when it's on
this side of the membrane,

287
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,012
a hydrogen can become attached
right there.

288
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:13,000
And this guy will want to
be attracted to that.

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,072
So he'll rotate around.

290
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:19,086
So you can imagine this-- if
this is kind of a wheel-- this

291
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,052
attraction.

292
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:23,065
Because the electron wants to
go into a lower energy state

293
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,037
right here.

294
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,097
It'll rotate around.

295
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:29,095
That'll allow, essentially, this
hydrogen as it rotates.

296
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,082
As this molecule, as this
protein rotates around this

297
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:35,004
hydrogen will be able to
cross the barrier.

298
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:38,028
And then once this guy and
that guy meet, then the

299
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,075
hydrogen will be on
the other side.

300
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,094
And so it can freely
go away again.

301
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:47,041
So that's, at least in my
head, how I imagine the

302
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,067
electrons going from a high
energy state to a lower energy

303
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:52,025
state, how that can actually
drive a reaction.

304
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:53,095
Remember, the electrons
want to do this.

305
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:55,075
So they'll attract the different
parts of the

306
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,091
molecules together.

307
00:13:56,091 --> 00:14:00,025
And as those molecules turn and
rotate and move, that can

308
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:04,013
help facilitate hydrogen going
from the stroma, the outside

309
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:07,044
of the thylakoid, to the inside
of the thylakoid.

310
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:10,026
That will drive the chemiosmosis
later on.

311
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:13,030
Now there's one other point
I want to touch on here.

312
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,059
Everything I've described so
far, we started with an

313
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:17,001
electron in water.

314
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:21,087
And obviously when water loses
its hydrogens, it loses both

315
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:24,075
the hydrogen protons and
electrons associated with it.

316
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:26,071
You end up with just water.

317
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:30,041
So you start off with hydrogens
and then you end up

318
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,032
with just O2.

319
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,066
And then the hydrogen protons--
the electron got

320
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,073
taken up by the chlorophyll.

321
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:42,007
When you start off with that,
we've seen already that you

322
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,022
end up with the electron
sitting in NADPH.

323
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,039
The electron sitting
out here in NADPH.

324
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,095
At some point you have NAD
as the final acceptor.

325
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,029
Let me do it in the
right color.

326
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,060
You have NAD plus as
the final acceptor.

327
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,085
And it becomes NADPH.

328
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:03,007


329
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,082
You can imagine it accepts
maybe a hydrogen

330
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,002
proton from out here.

331
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:09,057
It accepts the electron from
this electron transport chain

332
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:10,099
in photosynthesis.

333
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:14,057
And it becomes NADPH and that
travels in the stroma, which

334
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:17,023
is where the dark reactions
occur that actually produce

335
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:18,034
the carbohydrate.

336
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:22,071
But this idea of an electron
going from water to NADPH,

337
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:39,071
this is called non-cyclic
photophosphorylation And it's

338
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:43,015
called non-cyclic because you're
not reusing the same

339
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:44,061
electrons over and over again.

340
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,070
The electrons start off, and
depending how you view it, in

341
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,070
the chlorophyll or the water.

342
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,027
And they end up in the NADPH.

343
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:53,063
Now there's another type of
photophosphorylation and you

344
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:55,036
might guess what it's called.

345
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:57,074
It's called cyclic.

346
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:02,047
Cyclic photophosphorylation
We'll see when we study the

347
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,027
dark cycles or the Calvin cycle
or the dark reactions or

348
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:08,072
the light independent
reactions, that it

349
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,096
uses a lot of ATP.

350
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:12,041
Actually ATP in disproportion
to the

351
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,028
amount of NADPH it uses.

352
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:17,013
It uses both, but it
uses a ton of ATP.

353
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:24,073
So cyclic phosphorylation only
produces ATP and actually does

354
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,037
not oxidize water.

355
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:29,065
So what happens in that
situation is this electron,

356
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:33,052
after it gets activated or
after it gets excited in

357
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:37,054
photosystem I, it's the
electron, it eventually ends

358
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:43,047
up-- instead of at NADPH, it
ends up at photosystem II.

359
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:46,041
So instead of this guy having
to be replaced by electrons

360
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:50,099
from water, this guy, in cyclic
photophosphorylation

361
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:53,038
ends up-- well, maybe I should
do it from here-- ends up

362
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:55,098
getting replaced by the
original electrons.

363
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,015
It gets excited here.

364
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,080
It goes from molecule to
molecule, lower energy states,

365
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,014
hydrogen gets pumped
into the lumen.

366
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:06,003
Gets excited again in
photosystem I and it enters

367
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,049
lower and lower energy states.

368
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:10,004
But then ends up again
in photosystem II.

369
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,031
That is cyclic
photophosphorylation.

370
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,014
So you can imagine in this
situation, since the electron

371
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:20,019
never ends up at NAD plus, you
don't end up producing NADPH.

372
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:24,000
And since you're replacing
this electron from the

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,023
photosynthesis or from the
electron transport chain

374
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:29,010
directly, you don't
have to strip the

375
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,096
electrons off of the water.

376
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,090
So you're not going to
produce your oxygen.

377
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,035
So, in this situation--
so this non-cyclic

378
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,061
phosphorylation, which
is kind of what most

379
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,004
photophosphorylation, is what
most people associate with

380
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:48,002
photophosphorylation, this
produces O2 and NADPH.

381
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:51,016


382
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,047
And of course it produces ATP.

383
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:56,031
While cyclic
photophosphorylation, because

384
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,089
it doesn't have to strip
electrons off of water and the

385
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:07,015
electrons don't end up at NADPH,
only produces ATP.

386
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:10,059
So I think we now have a very
good understanding, hopefully,

387
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,001
of the light reactions
in photosynthesis.

388
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,019
We're now ready to take
the products of this.

389
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,080
Now let's remember what
the products were.

390
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,066
Well, the oxygen just
gets eliminated.

391
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,014
We don't need the
oxygen anymore.

392
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:22,096
But that goes into the
atmosphere and you and I can

393
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:25,040
breathe that and we can use that
for cellular respiration.

394
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,002
But in the photosynthesis
context, we've now generated a

395
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:30,043
bunch of ATP.

396
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,060
And now we have a
bunch of NADPH.

397
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,075
And we can use that in
conjunction with carbon

398
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:44,024
dioxide to produce actual
carbohydrates in the stroma.

399
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,082
Outside the thylakoids, but
we're still inside of the

400
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:50,050
chloroplast. And I'll cover
that in the next video.

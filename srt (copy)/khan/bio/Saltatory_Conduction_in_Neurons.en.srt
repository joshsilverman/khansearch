1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033


2
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,066
In the last video, we got an
overview of electrotonic

3
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:06,078
potentials and action potentials
and how they

4
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:11,016
essentially can transmit
potential differences through

5
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:14,094
a cell or how they can
move a potential

6
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,084
difference through a cell.

7
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:18,091
And just as a bit of review,
electrotonic is if you have

8
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:21,030
some type of charge disruption--
let's say a

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,017
sodium gate opens and a bunch of
positive ions flow in, that

10
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:28,080
very quickly is going to
make things nearby

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,012
more positive, right?

12
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:32,025
It's very quickly because the
positive charges are going to

13
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,032
move away from their
positive brethren.

14
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:37,093
Positives and positives
repel each other.

15
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,082
And so if we go some point
further off in the cell--

16
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,049
let's say we were looking at
that point right here-- the

17
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,089
positive charges-- if there's
a positive charge here, it's

18
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:46,059
going to want to move
in that direction.

19
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,087
If you have a positive charge
here, it's going to move in

20
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:48,035
this direction.

21
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:51,022
So it's going to become more
positive very quickly.

22
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:53,075
So that's what we talk about
electrotonic potential.

23
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,025
And the benefit is, it happens
very, very quickly.

24
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,096
If we're looking at this
point, as soon as these

25
00:00:57,096 --> 00:01:01,035
positive charges move in, a
positive charge here that's

26
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:04,020
right there is going to want to
move there and a positive

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,054
charge that's here is going to
want to move to the right, but

28
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:10,001
not as quickly because the the
effect gets diffused, right?

29
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,056
The impact on this charge is
less than this charge because

30
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:13,045
it's further away.

31
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,082
And we could think more, we
could run computer simulations

32
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:17,009
about it, but I think you
get the general idea.

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,048
Positive things flow in.

34
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,039
Other positive things
want to move away.

35
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:23,059
That makes any point that's some
distance away from that

36
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:27,037
disruption a little bit more
positive so it'll affect its

37
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:29,001
voltage almost immediately.

38
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,015
So it's very fast, but
the problem is it

39
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,026
dissipates with distance.

40
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,029
If we go really far from that--
if we went all the way

41
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:37,034
down here, this guy would have
almost no impact from what's

42
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:40,009
happening at this opening
of this sodium gate.

43
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:41,048
So that's its negative.

44
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,087
On the other hand, on the other
side of the spectrum, we

45
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:45,064
looked at action potentials.

46
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,032
Action potentials
are all about--

47
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,065
you have some stimulus.

48
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:52,081
In general, it's getting a
little bit of a positive

49
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,054
charge near a sodium gate.

50
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:59,031
So normally, we're resting
at minus 70 millvolts.

51
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,059
Maybe you have a little bit of
a positive charge come, maybe

52
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:05,051
through some type of
electrotonic interaction, but

53
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,023
that's not enough.

54
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:09,077
But maybe another one comes by
and it gets you to minus 55

55
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:13,050
millvolts and then the gate
opens, sodium floods in, we

56
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,059
become much more positive.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:17,084
Then the sodium gates close.

58
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,084
Potassium gates open.

59
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,081
The potassium wants to flow out
of the cell because we're

60
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:24,093
positive in the cell now and
there's a lot of potassium on

61
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,040
the inside because of the
sodium potassium pumps.

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,075
So then we go back
to negative.

63
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,046
We actually overshoot.

64
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:32,005
And just in case you want to
know, at this point, we're

65
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,062
kind of in this refractory
period.

66
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:36,086
And the original gate that just
opened and closed-- it's

67
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:38,059
deactivated for a short
period of time.

68
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,053
So there's some period of time
that another stimulus won't be

69
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:42,099
able to do it, but then our
sodium potassium pumps can get

70
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,078
us back to normal.

71
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:47,037
But the whole time that that
was happening, as the gate

72
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:50,053
that was to the left got all
charged up, as the sodium

73
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:53,053
started flowing in, it's
obviously going to make it a

74
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,028
little bit more positive to the
gate that's directly to

75
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,015
the right of it.

76
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,008
So the gate that's to the right
of it, its charge is

77
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:02,099
going to go slightly up and
then bam, it hits its

78
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,028
threshold for firing.

79
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:07,049
So then that sodium gate opens
and the same thing happens a

80
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,059
little bit further
to the right.

81
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,012
And I could keep doing that,
maybe even a little bit

82
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:11,012
further to right.

83
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,078
A gate's potential might look
something like that and that's

84
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,055
how it travels.

85
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:16,081
Now the benefit of this is that
the signal never loses

86
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,094
strength, right?

87
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:20,003
We can just keep going down
the cell like this.

88
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:22,087
We could do that for millions
of miles if we had to.

89
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:26,062
The negative is that it's slower
than electrotonic in

90
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:30,012
that you have to open and close
these gates and it also

91
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:33,068
requires energy because you're
always having to re-balance

92
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,091
the charge potential between
the inside and the

93
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,080
outside of the cell.

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,040
So we need to think about, how
could a cell use both of these

95
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,037
things to optimize those
tradeoffs between signal

96
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,031
dissipation and speed?

97
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:50,012
And this is exactly what
the neuron does do.

98
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:50,093
So let's go back.

99
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:53,046
Now we're ready to close the
loop and actually talk about

100
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,040
the neuron.

101
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,066
So when I talked about a neuron
getting excited on the

102
00:03:56,066 --> 00:04:00,031
dendrite-- if I zoom in on a
dendrite-- let's say this is a

103
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,034
dendrite's membrane
right here.

104
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,044
Let me zoom in on a dendrite.

105
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:08,071
So that's the dendrite
right there.

106
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:10,086
Let's say that this
is a drawing of

107
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,006
that point right there.

108
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:15,009
When I say stimulated, what's
happening is, some channel is

109
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,070
being triggered, some gate
is being opened.

110
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,076
And so let's say that this is
a sodium channel and it

111
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:25,043
stimulates-- the stimulus, it
could be-- like in our action

112
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,080
potential-- it could
be voltage gated.

113
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,081
A higher voltage might
cause it to happen.

114
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,031
It might be some chemical
stimulus from some other

115
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,085
terminal end of some
other axon.

116
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,059
It could be pressure.

117
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,010
It could be, who knows?

118
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,033
It could be some molecule that
stimulates it, but something

119
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:42,049
is making a gate open and maybe
it's a sodium gate and

120
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,035
so positive charge is going
to flood in here.

121
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,076
Positive charge is going
to flow into the cell.

122
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,089
We know why it does that.

123
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,043
There's a lot of sodium
on the outside.

124
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,025
That's what the sodium
potassium pump does.

125
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,066
So positive charge flows
into the cell.

126
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,088
So immediately, it's going
to have some impact.

127
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,056
If we measure the voltage here,
immediately the positive

128
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:04,031
charge here is going to want
to travel away and so this

129
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,039
point is going to become a
little bit more positive.

130
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,087
If we look at this point, it's
going to become a little bit

131
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:11,087
more positive, but it's so far
away from the original

132
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:17,006
reaction that maybe it doesn't
become as positive because the

133
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,067
ions are becoming dissipated
as we go through the cell.

134
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:23,024
So as we go right here
to our axon hillock,

135
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,063
we have more gates.

136
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:27,051
Let's say that that's
a sodium gate.

137
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,094
Let's say that this is
a potassium gate.

138
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,072
Let's say that we have
another sodium gate.

139
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:33,093
Doesn't have to be configured
this way.

140
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:36,087
We have another potassium
gate right there.

141
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:40,006
Now if we just had one event
here, we're so far away from

142
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,047
that event that maybe if we
measured the potential at that

143
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,086
point, at the axon hillock--
remember, that's the little

144
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:49,043
bulge that turns
into the axon.

145
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:52,037
Let's do that same chart that
I had before, where we have

146
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,014
membrane potential.

147
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:56,037
So potential across
the membrane.

148
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:58,012
And then we have time.

149
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,018
So if we look at this point--
let's say we're looking at

150
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:03,035
this point right here, that
point and we're comparing it

151
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,012
to the outside of
the membrane.

152
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:08,054
So it's starting at minus
70 millivolts.

153
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,062
That's its resting.

154
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:11,093
And let's say that some event
happened out here and

155
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:14,092
electrotonically it's going to
increase the potential a

156
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,081
little bit because positive
charge is going to make its

157
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:18,030
way and they're all going
to push each other.

158
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,006
They're all going to get away
from each other and this one's

159
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,000
going to become slightly
positive.

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,062
But let's say it only goes to
minus 65, nothing happens.

161
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:30,073
Then your sodium potassium
pumps come into effect so

162
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:31,085
nothing really happened.

163
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:35,030
It didn't trigger the neuron,
but let's say that gets

164
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,035
stimulated again and let's say
there's a couple more that get

165
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:40,056
stimulated and their combined
effects-- because all of them

166
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:43,087
are flooding with positive
ions now-- their combined

167
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:47,042
effects are enough to get this
point to the threshold.

168
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:52,014
So they're enough to get
this point to minus 55.

169
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:53,089
And we know what's going
to happen here.

170
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:58,091
As soon as this sodium gate gets
to minus 55, it's going

171
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,023
to open up.

172
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:02,076
It's going to open up and sodium
is going to flood in.

173
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:05,073
Sodium is going to flood in
until we get to positive 40.

174
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,025
then it's going to close.

175
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:11,057
Then the potassium gate's going
to open and get us back

176
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,004
to where we were before.

177
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,025
We're going to overshoot a
little bit and then our sodium

178
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,051
potassium pump's going to get
back to where we wanted.

179
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:22,035
That's going to happen there,
but as the sodium is floating

180
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:25,050
in into that first gate, this
guy's going to become positive

181
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,062
here and then this gate, this
sodium gate, is going to

182
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,033
become triggered.

183
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,047
And this is that action
potential idea.

184
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,054
Now, we could just keep going
our action potential all the

185
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:39,020
way down the axon because we
said the benefit of the

186
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,011
electrotonic is that it goes
fast, but doesn't cover a lot

187
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:42,054
of distance.

188
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:46,086
This is a relatively short
distance, while the axon is

189
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,056
super-long.

190
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:50,067
So you might say, OK, I see,
electrotonic from the dendrite

191
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:55,031
to the axon hillock-- and then
we use action potential all

192
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:58,013
the way down the axon.

193
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,038
That would be reasonable because
we're not going to

194
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:00,044
lose our signal strength.

195
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:03,012
We would keep having that
domino, that chain reaction

196
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:05,041
going all the way until we get
to our terminal end, but the

197
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,056
problem there is, it's slow.

198
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:10,025
I mean, if this is a five foot
long axon, I don't want to

199
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:11,023
have a slow signal.

200
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,052
If someone just bit me, I
want to move my hand.

201
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:15,056
If I just touched a stove, I
want to move my hand quickly.

202
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:18,004
I don't want all that signal
to take so much time, all

203
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,057
these gates to open and close
along the whole four or five

204
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,097
feet-- of if I'm a dinosaur,
move my arm.

205
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:24,076
It needs to happen quickly.

206
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,049
So what happens is that
there's a combination.

207
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:31,089


208
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,035
You get your signal and this
amplifies the signal.

209
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:36,020
The signal is very
weak here, right?

210
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,013
It only got us to minus 55,
but then when that first

211
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:43,008
sodium gate opens, it creates a
huge positive potential that

212
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:43,096
opens the next gate.

213
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:46,063
So we have a huge positive
potential here.

214
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:50,029
Now the axons have these
huge spaces where

215
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,037
they're covered up.

216
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,059
They're covered up by these
Schwann cells or by these

217
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,074
myelin sheaths.

218
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:57,009
So even if there are
gates underneath

219
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,050
them, they're useless.

220
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,046
They can't interface with
the outside sodiums and

221
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:07,099
potassiums. So over this
distance of the axon, you

222
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:10,086
cannot have a straight-up
action potential.

223
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:13,026
What happened is, your action
potential here, it made

224
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:16,050
everything a lot more positive
than it would have been had

225
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,048
there not been that opening of
the gate and now you can have

226
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,069
an electrotonic effect again.

227
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,049
So you kind of boosted
your signal.

228
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:26,059
So now this might
get to plus 40.

229
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:31,016
Maybe over here we only get to
minus 50, but minus 50, once

230
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:36,094
again is enough to trigger a
sodium gate, which then makes

231
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:40,053
everything really
positive again.

232
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:42,025
It boosts the signal.

233
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,094
It makes everything positive
again, then your potassium

234
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:47,057
gates, everything, comes
out of the cell again.

235
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,032
So everything gets back
to normal, but

236
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,025
it boosted the signal.

237
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:54,062
Now electrotonically, this
is super positive.

238
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:57,061
Now the electrotonic effect,
if we go some distance down

239
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:00,027
the axon, this'll be less
positive, but it'll be just

240
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:03,016
enough to trigger another
action potential.

241
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,075
And then that happens again.

242
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:07,049
So we have this combination
of action potentials with

243
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,037
electrotonics.

244
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:11,091
So electrotonic-- this is very
fast. This is a fast

245
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,035
interaction.

246
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:15,044
It happens immediately,
but it dissipates

247
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,036
as it covers distance.

248
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:19,020
So we can't have these nodes
of Ranvier being super far

249
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,005
from each other.

250
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:23,090
They have to be just far enough
so that when one action

251
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,042
potential happens, that
it's still enough to

252
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,051
trigger the next one.

253
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:30,044
It's not going to boost its
potential to plus 40, but as

254
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:34,052
long as it boosts it to minus
55, we're still going to

255
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,097
produce a signal to
keep moving on.

256
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,063
So this is a really good
tradeoff because we get fast,

257
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,046
slow, but it boosts
the signal.

258
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:45,019
Fast signal dies down, but it's
enough to essentially

259
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,063
trigger this guy and then
it boosts the signal.

260
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,024
It's slow, but then we
travel fast again.

261
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,035
Signal dies, boosts the signal
slow, and we keep traveling

262
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,066
that way down the axon.

263
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:58,083
And this is actually called
a saltatory conduction.

264
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,026
Let me write this down.

265
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:05,060


266
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,071
Saltatory conduction, which
I think comes from

267
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:10,010
the Latin for hopping.

268
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,016
I remember when I first learned
this in biology class,

269
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,079
they kind of talked about it.

270
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,016
Somehow putting the myelin
sheath there just magically

271
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:20,017
made it happen faster and these
things just hop from one

272
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,095
action potential reaction
to another, but

273
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,021
that's not what's happening.

274
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:25,089
You're boosting the signal here
with an action potential.

275
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,001
When these gates open, it
becomes super positive.

276
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,076
When it becomes super positive
here-- from a maybe not so

277
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:35,046
positive trigger becomes super
positive, that allows this

278
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:37,077
point to become reasonably
positive, enough to trigger

279
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:39,002
the next reaction.

280
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,004
When that triggers, then it
becomes super positive, makes

281
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,041
this reasonably positive
or less negative, it

282
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,039
triggers the next one.

283
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,060
So it's a combination of action
potentials that boosts

284
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,029
the signal.

285
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,026
And electrotonic effects that
move the signal, that gives us

286
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:54,053
this saltatory conduction.

287
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,064
So that's actually how neurons
are able to make that tradeoff

288
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:01,030
between traveling huge
distances, but not losing

289
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,090
their signal.

290
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,015

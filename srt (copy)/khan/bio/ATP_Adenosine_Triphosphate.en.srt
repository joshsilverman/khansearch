1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,061


2
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:03,035
Arguably, one of the most
important molecules in all of

3
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:06,015
biology is ATP.

4
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:08,061
ATP, which stands for adenosine
triphosphate.

5
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:18,069


6
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:20,033
Which sounds very fancy.

7
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:24,026
But all you need to remember,
or any time you see ATP

8
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:28,017
hanging around in some type
of biochemical reaction,

9
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:30,094
something in your brain should
say, hey, we're dealing with

10
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:32,035
biological energy.

11
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:38,068
Or another way to think of ATP
is the currency-- I'll put

12
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:42,064
that in quotes-- of
biological energy.

13
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:46,082


14
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:49,000
So how is it a currency
of energy?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,082
Well ATP stores energy
in its bonds.

16
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:54,003
And I'll explain what that
means in a second.

17
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,021
And before we learn what
an adenosine group or a

18
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,086
3-phosphate group looks like,
you can just take a bit of a

19
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:03,000
leap of faith, that you could
imagine ATP as being made up

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,015
of something called-- let me
do it in a nice color-- an

21
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,095
adenosine group right there.

22
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:12,001
And then attached to it you'll
have three phosphates.

23
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,031
Not might, you will.

24
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:18,015
You'll have three phosphates
attached to it just like that.

25
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:21,096
And this is ATP.

26
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:24,045
Adenosine triphosphate.

27
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:27,084
Tri- meaning three
phosphate groups.

28
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:31,023
Now if you take adenosine
triphosphate and you hydrolyze

29
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:33,045
this bond, which means
if you take this in

30
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,060
the presence of water.

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,025
So let me just throw
some water in here.

32
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:41,060
Let's say I have H2O.

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,045
Then one of these phosphate
groups will break off.

34
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:47,009
Essentially part of this water
joins to this phosphate group,

35
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,090
and then part of it
joins to this

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,090
phosphate group right there.

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,059
And I'll show you that in a
little bit more detail.

38
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,095
But I want to give you the
big picture first.

39
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:57,043
What you're left with is an
adenosine group that now has

40
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,068
two phosphates on it.

41
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:01,045


42
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:07,051
And this is called adenosine
diphosphate or ADP.

43
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:11,086
Before we had triphosphate,
which means three phosphates.

44
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:14,033
Now we have diphosphate,
adenosine triphosphate, so

45
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,065
instead of a tri here
we just write a di.

46
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:18,059
Which means you have two
phosphate groups.

47
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:22,075
And so the ATP has been
hydrolyzed, or you have broken

48
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,078
off one of these phosphate
groups.

49
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:27,055
And so now you're left with
ADP and then an extra

50
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:30,055
phosphate group right here.

51
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:33,037
And-- and this is the whole key
to everything that we talk

52
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:35,065
about when we're dealing
with ATP-- and

53
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:36,090
you have some energy.

54
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,043


55
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:45,059
And so when I talk about ATP
being the currency of

56
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:48,050
biological energy,
this is why.

57
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,021
Is that if you have ATP, and if
you were to-- through some

58
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:55,096
chemical reaction-- you pop off
this phosphate right here.

59
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:57,046
It's going to generate energy.

60
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,096
That energy can be used
for just general heat.

61
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,081
Or you could couple this
reaction with other reactions

62
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,083
that require energy.

63
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,096
And then those reactions will
be able to move forward.

64
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:10,049
So, I draw these circles.

65
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,003
Adenosine and phosphates.

66
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:15,000
And really, this is all
you need to know.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,078
Already, what I've shown you
right here is really all you

68
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:20,065
need to know to operationally
think of how ATP operates in

69
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,038
most biological systems.
And if you want to

70
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:22,074
go the other way.

71
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,002
If you have energy and you
want to generate ATP, the

72
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,005
reaction will just
go this way.

73
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,043
Energy plus a phosphate group
plus some ADP, you

74
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,061
can go back to ATP.

75
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,093
And so this is stored energy.

76
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:36,052
So this side of the equation
is stored energy.

77
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:39,021
And this side of the equation
is used energy.

78
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:43,081
And this is really all you--
well this is 95% of what you

79
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,043
need to know to really
understand the function of ATP

80
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,044
in biological systems. It's just
a store of energy when

81
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,015
you-- ATP has energy.

82
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:54,006
When you break a phosphate
off, it generates energy.

83
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,069
And then if you want to go from
ADP and a phosphate back

84
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,058
to ATP, you have to use
energy up again.

85
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:02,003
So if you have ATP, that's
a source of energy.

86
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:06,058
If you have ADP and you want
ATP, you need to use energy.

87
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:09,050
And so far I've just drawn a
circle with an A around it and

88
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,046
said that's an adenosine.

89
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,084
But sometimes I think it's
satisfying to see what the

90
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,018
molecule actually looks like.

91
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:17,000
So I cut and pasted this
from Wikipedia.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,031
And the reason why I didn't show
this to you initially is

93
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:20,082
because this looks
very complicated.

94
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:24,077
While the conceptual reason
why ATP is the currency of

95
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:26,070
energy, I think is fairly
straightforward.

96
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,019
When it has three phosphates,
one phosphate can break off.

97
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,031
And then that'll result
with some energy being

98
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,063
put into the system.

99
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:36,056
Or if you want to attach
that phosphate you

100
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,056
have to use up energy.

101
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,091
That's just the basic
principle of ATP.

102
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:44,000
But this is its actual
structure.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,022
But even here we can break it
down and see that it's really

104
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:47,074
not too bad.

105
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:48,079
We said adenosine.

106
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,049
Let me draw the adenosine
group.

107
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,066
We have adenosine.

108
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:54,022
This right here is adenosine.

109
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:57,006
This part of the molecule
right there.

110
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,047
That is adenosine.

111
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,027


112
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:04,033
And for those of you that have
really paid attention to some

113
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:07,056
of the other videos, you might
recognize that this part of

114
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,066
adenosine-- so this is called
adenosine, but this part right

115
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,081
here-- is adenine.

116
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:17,012


117
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:21,011
Which is the same adenine that
makes up the nucleotides that

118
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,045
are the backbone of DNA.

119
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,087
So some of these molecules in
biological systems have more

120
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,057
than one use.

121
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,091
This is the same adenine
where we talk

122
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:30,017
about adenine and guanine.

123
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:31,010
This is a purine.

124
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,037
And there's also the
pyrimidines, but I won't go

125
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:33,092
into that much.

126
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,018
But that's the same molecule.

127
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,037
So that's just an interesting
thing.

128
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:39,094
The same thing that makes up DNA
is also part of what makes

129
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:42,093
up these energy currency
molecules.

130
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:47,069
So the adenine makes part of
the adenosine part of ATP.

131
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,020
And then the other part
right here is ribose.

132
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,032


133
00:05:55,032 --> 00:06:00,097
Which you might also recognize
from RNA, ribonucleic acid.

134
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:03,004
That's because you have
ribose dealing

135
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,014
in the whole situation.

136
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,018
But I won't go into that much.

137
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:08,097
But ribose is just
a 5-carbon sugar.

138
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:11,033
When they don't draw the
molecule, it's implied that

139
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,094
it's a carbon.

140
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:15,016
So this is one carbon right
there, two carbons, three

141
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:18,064
carbons, four carbons,
five carbons.

142
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,072
And that's just nice to know.

143
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,083
It's nice to know that they
share parts of their

144
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,069
molecules with DNA.

145
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,037
And these are familiar building
blocks that we see

146
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,025
over and over again.

147
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,092
But I want to emphasize that
knowing this, or memorizing

148
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:32,026
this, in no way will help you
understand the simpler

149
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:35,036
understanding of ATP
just being what

150
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:37,051
drives biological reactions.

151
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:41,051
And then here I drew 3-phosphate
groups, and this

152
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:43,035
is their actual molecular
structure.

153
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,049
Their Lewis structures
right here.

154
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,017
That's one phosphate group.

155
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,052
This is the second
phosphate group.

156
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:52,031
And this is a third
phosphate group.

157
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:54,097
Just like that.

158
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:58,082
When I first learned this, my
first question was, OK I can

159
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:02,007
take this as a leap of faith
that if you take one of these

160
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,058
phosphate groups off or if this
bond is hydrolyzed, that

161
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,001
somehow that releases energy.

162
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,087
And then I kind of went on and
answered all the questions

163
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,056
that I had to answer.

164
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,094
But why does it release
energy?

165
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:13,092
What is it about this bond
that releases energy?

166
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:16,068
Remember all bonds are are
electrons being shared with

167
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,082
different atoms.

168
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:21,018
So the best way you could think
about it is right here.

169
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:24,089
These electrons that are being
shared right across this bond,

170
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:27,062
or this electron that's being
shared right across this bond,

171
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,047
and it's coming from
the phosphate.

172
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,068
I won't draw the periodic
table right now.

173
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:34,049
But you know the phosphate has
five electrons to share.

174
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:37,037
It's less electronegative than
oxygen, so oxygen will kind of

175
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,045
hog the electron.

176
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:41,031
But this electron is
very uncomfortable.

177
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,093
There's a couple of reasons
why it is uncomfortable.

178
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,069
It's in a high energy state.

179
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,025
One reason why is, you
have all these

180
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,072
negative oxygens here.

181
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,058
So they kind of want to push
away from each other.

182
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:55,095
So these electrons in this bond
really can't kind of get

183
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,022
close to the nucleus.

184
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,067
They'll go into kind of
a low energy state.

185
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:03,000
All of this is more of an
analogy than the reality.

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,020
We all know that electrons
can get quite complex.

187
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,043
And there's a whole quantum
mechanical world.

188
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:08,037
But that's a good way
to think of it.

189
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,083
That these molecules want to
be away from each other.

190
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,032
But you have these bonds, so
this electron, it's kind of in

191
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,039
a high energy state.

192
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,025
It's further from the nucleuses
of these two atoms

193
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,057
than it might want to be.

194
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:22,022
And when you pop this phosphate
group off, all of a

195
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,087
sudden these electrons
can enter into a

196
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,011
lower energy state.

197
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,007
And that generates energy.

198
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:32,002
So this energy right here is
always-- in fact in any

199
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,040
chemical reaction where they say
energy is generated, it's

200
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,020
always from electrons going
to a lower energy state.

201
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:47,050


202
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,057
That's what it's all about.

203
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,061
And later in future videos
when we do cellular

204
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:54,048
respiration and glycolysis and
all that, whenever we show

205
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:57,033
energy, it's really from
electrons going from

206
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,089
uncomfortable states to more
comfortable states.

207
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,063
And in the process they
generate energy.

208
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,062
If I'm in a plane or I'm jumping
out of a plane, I have

209
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:07,017
a lot of potential energy
right when I

210
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,004
jump out of the plane.

211
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:10,027
And you can view that as
an uncomfortable state.

212
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,035
And then when I'm sitting on my
couch watching football, I

213
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,069
have a lot less potential
energy, so that's a very

214
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,050
comfortable state.

215
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,078
And I could have generated
a lot of energy

216
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:20,048
falling to my couch.

217
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:21,059
But I don't knows.

218
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,053
My analogies always break
down at some point.

219
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:28,023
Now, the last thing I want to go
over for you is exactly how

220
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,052
this reaction happens.

221
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:32,040
So far you could turn off this
video and you could already

222
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,067
deal with ATP as it is used
in 95% of biology,

223
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,078
especially AP Bio.

224
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,062
But I want you to understand
how this

225
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:40,032
reaction actually happens.

226
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:43,011
So to do that, what I'm going
to do is copy and

227
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,014
paste parts of these.

228
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:46,016
So I already told you that this
guy right here is going

229
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:51,027
to break off of the ATP.

230
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:58,049


231
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:01,002
So that's the phosphate
group that breaks off.

232
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,036
And then you have
the rest of it.

233
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,030
You have the ADP that's
left over.

234
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,052
So this is the ADP.

235
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:09,034
I don't even have to copy and
paste all of this stuff.

236
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:12,000
You can just accept that that's
the adenosine group.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,004


238
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,050
Just like that.

239
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,024
So we've already said that this
thing gets hydrolyzed

240
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,092
off, or gets cut off and
that generates energy.

241
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,076
But what I want to
do is actually

242
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:28,029
show you the mechanism.

243
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,025
A little bit of hand-wavy
mechanism of how

244
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:31,062
this actually happens.

245
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,082
So I said this reaction occurs
in the presence of water.

246
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:37,021
So let me draw some
water here.

247
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:40,003
So I have an oxygen
and a hydrogen.

248
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:42,010
And then I have another
hydrogen.

249
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,071
That's water right there.

250
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,036
So hydrolysis is just a reaction
where you say, hey,

251
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:51,041
this guy here, he wants to
bond with something or he

252
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,091
wants to share someone
else's electrons.

253
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:58,050
So maybe this hydrogen right
here goes down here and shares

254
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,025
its electron with this
oxygen right here.

255
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:06,032
And then this phosphorus, it has
an extra electron that it

256
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:06,082
needs to share.

257
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,019
Remember it has five valence
electrons; it wants to share

258
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,036
them with oxygen.

259
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:14,003
It has one, two, three, four
being shared right now.

260
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:17,066
Well, if this hydrogen goes to
this guy, then you're left

261
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,098
with this blue OH right here.

262
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:22,046
And this guy can share
one of the

263
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,080
phosphorus' extra electrons.

264
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,019
So you get the OH
just like that.

265
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,023
So that's the actual process
that happens.

266
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,035
And it could go the
other way as well.

267
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:33,003
I could've cleaved it here.

268
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:34,074
I could have cleaved the
whole thing here.

269
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:37,026
And so this guy would have
kept the oxygen and the

270
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:38,088
hydrogen would have
gone to him.

271
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,082
And then this guy would
have taken the OH.

272
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,053
It could happen in
either order.

273
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,076
And so either order
would be fine.

274
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:47,000
And there's one other point
I want to make.

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,043
And this is a little
bit more complex.

276
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,092
And I was even wondering whether
I wanted to make it.

277
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:53,030
My whole reason why you're
kind of in a lower energy

278
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,050
state is, once you break apart--
actually let me go

279
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,037
down here-- is because I said,
hey, this electron is happier

280
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:03,009
when it's-- so let's say this
electron that was part of this

281
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,075
phosphorus is happier now.

282
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,053
It's in a lower energy
state because

283
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:07,095
it's not being stretched.

284
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:10,035
It's not having to spend time
between that guy and that guy

285
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:13,004
because this molecule and this
molecule want to spread apart

286
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:14,055
because they have negative
charges.

287
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,090
That's part of the reason.

288
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,040
The other reason why, and we'll
talk about this in a lot

289
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,053
more detail when we learn more
about organic chemistry, is

290
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,094
that this has more resonance.

291
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:27,076
More resonance structures or
resonance configurations.

292
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:31,036
And all that means is that these
electrons, these extra

293
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:34,024
electrons here, they can kind
of move about between the

294
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:37,016
different atoms. And that makes
it even more stable.

295
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:40,090
So if you imagine that this
oxygen right here has an extra

296
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,070
electron with it.

297
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,084
So that extra electron right
there, it could come down here

298
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:51,017
and then form a double bond
with the phosphorus.

299
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,080
And then this electron right
here can then jump back up to

300
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,087
that oxygen.

301
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:58,039
And then that could happen on
this side and on that side.

302
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,099
And I won't go into the details,
but that's another

303
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:01,079
reason why it makes
it more stable.

304
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,059
If you've already taken organic
chemistry, you can

305
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,008
kind of appreciate that more.

306
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:07,057
But I don't want to get
all into the weeds.

307
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:11,012
The most important thing to
remember about ATP is that

308
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:14,046
when you cleave off a phosphate
group it generates

309
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:17,095
energy that can drive all sorts
of biological functions,

310
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:20,057
like growth and movement,
muscle movement, muscle

311
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:23,089
contraction, electrical
impulses in

312
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,028
nerves and the brain.

313
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:29,030
So this is the main battery
or currency of energy in

314
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,053
biological systems. That's the
main thing that you really

315
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:33,078
just need to remember
about ATP.

316
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,091

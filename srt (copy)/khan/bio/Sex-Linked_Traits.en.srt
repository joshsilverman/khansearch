1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
By this point in the biology
playlist, you're probably

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,058
wondering a very natural
question, how is gender

4
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:09,038
determined in an organism?

5
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:11,083
And it's not an obvious answer,
because throughout the

6
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:15,021
animal kingdom, it's actually
determined in different ways.

7
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:21,028
In some creatures, especially
some types of reptiles, it's

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:23,092
environmental.

9
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:26,030
Not all reptiles, but
certain cases of it.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,075
It could be maybe the
temperature in which the

11
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:32,032
embryo develops will dictate
whether it turns into a male

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,047
or female or other environmental
factors.

13
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:39,014
And in other types of animals,
especially mammals, of which

14
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:44,095
we are one example, it's
a genetic basis.

15
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:48,017
And so your next question is,
hey, Sal, so-- let me write

16
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:57,088
this down, in mammals it's
genetic-- so, OK, maybe

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,029
they're different alleles, a
male or a female allele.

18
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,046
But then you're like, hey, but
there's so many different

19
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:06,045
characteristics that
differentiate

20
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,004
a man from a woman.

21
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:10,020
Maybe it would have to be a
whole set of genes that have

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,031
to work together.

23
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,004
And to some degree,
your second answer

24
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,029
would be more correct.

25
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:16,071


26
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:18,068
It's even more than just
a set of genes.

27
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:21,040
It's actually whole chromosomes
determine it.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,035
So let me draw a nucleus.

29
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:25,054
That's going to be my nucleus.

30
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:27,059
And this is going to be
the nucleus for a man.

31
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:31,075
So 22 of the pairs of
chromosomes are just regular

32
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,067
non-sex-determining
chromosomes.

33
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:39,004
So I could just do, that's one
of the homologous, 2, 4, 6, 8,

34
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:41,037
10, 12, 14.

35
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,034
I can just keep going.

36
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:45,059
And eventually you
have 22 pairs.

37
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:51,023
So these 22 pairs right there,
they're called autosomal.

38
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:54,007
And those are just our standard
pairs of chromosomes

39
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,034
that code for different
things.

40
00:01:55,034 --> 00:02:02,084
Each of these right here is a
homologous pair, homologous,

41
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:04,082
which we learned before
you get one from

42
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,056
each of your parents.

43
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:08,040
They don't necessarily code for
the same thing, for the

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,021
same versions of the genes,
but they code

45
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,021
for the same genes.

46
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,044
If eye color is on this gene,
it's also on that gene, on the

47
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:15,063
other gene of the
homologous pair.

48
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:17,009
Although you might have
different versions of eye

49
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,066
color on either one and that
determines what you display.

50
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:24,016
But these are just kind of the
standard genes that have

51
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,046
nothing to do with our gender.

52
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:29,003
And then you have these two
other special chromosomes.

53
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,066


54
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,046
I'll do this one.

55
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:36,059
It'll be a long brown one, and
then I'll do a short blue one.

56
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:39,015
And the first thing you'll
notice is that they don't look

57
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:39,099
homologous.

58
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,002
How could they code for the same
thing when the blue one

59
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,018
is short and the brown
one's long?

60
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:44,086
And that's true.

61
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,047
They aren't homologous.

62
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:49,022
And these we'll call our
sex-determining chromosomes.

63
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:59,090


64
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,068
And the long one right here,
it's been the convention to

65
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,005
call that the x chromosome.

66
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,065


67
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:09,024
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

68
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:13,062
And the blue one right there,
we refer to that as the y

69
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:16,034
chromosome.

70
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:18,072
And to figure out whether
something is a male or a

71
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,084
female, it's a pretty
simple system.

72
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:23,090
If you've got a y chromosome,
you are a male.

73
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,084
So let me write that down.

74
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:29,081
So this nucleus that I drew
just here-- obviously you

75
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:32,018
could have the whole broader
cell all around here-- this is

76
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:34,003
the nucleus for a man.

77
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:36,096
So if you have an x chromosome--
and we'll talk

78
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:39,065
about in a second why you can
only get that from your mom--

79
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,099
an x chromosome from your mom
and a y chromosome from your

80
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,028
dad, you will be a male.

81
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:50,011
If you get an x chromosome
from your mom and an x

82
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:54,059
chromosome from your dad, you're
going to be a female.

83
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,009
And so we could actually even
draw a Punnett square.

84
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,071
This is almost a trivially easy
Punnett square, but it

85
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:02,031
kind of shows what all of the
different possibilities are.

86
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:05,086
So let's say this is your
mom's genotype for her

87
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,034
sex-determining chromosome.

88
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,013
She's got two x's.

89
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,091
That's what makes her your
mom and not your dad.

90
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:16,098
And then your dad has an x and
a y-- I should do it in

91
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:19,099
capital-- and has
a Y chromosome.

92
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,085
And we can do a Punnett
square.

93
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,030
What are all the different
combinations of offspring?

94
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,044
Well, your mom could give this
X chromosome, in conjunction

95
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:28,042
with this X chromosome
from your dad.

96
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,057
This would produce a female.

97
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,062
Your mom could give this other
X chromosome with that X

98
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,077
chromosome.

99
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:35,054
That would be a female
as well.

100
00:04:35,054 --> 00:04:37,049
Well, your mom's always going
to be donating an X

101
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,033
chromosome.

102
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:42,018
And then your dad is going to
donate either the X or the Y.

103
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:44,050
So in this case, it'll
be the Y chromosome.

104
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,089
So these would be female,
and those would be male.

105
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,013
And it works out nicely
that half are female

106
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,058
and half are male.

107
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:56,044
But a very interesting and
somewhat ironic fact might pop

108
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:59,085
out at you when you see this.

109
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:04,026
Who determines whether their
offspring are male or female?

110
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:07,037
Is it the mom or the dad?

111
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:10,083
Well, the mom always donates an
X chromosome, so in no way

112
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:17,006
does what the haploid genetic
makeup of the mom's eggs, of

113
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:20,051
the gamete from the female, in
no way does that determine the

114
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,002
gender of the offspring.

115
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:26,097
It's all determined by whether--
let me just draw a

116
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:31,094
bunch of-- dad's got a lot of
sperm, and they're all racing

117
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:34,000
towards the egg.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,038
And some of them have an X
chromosome in them and some of

119
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,000
them have a Y chromosome
in them.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,061
And obviously they
have others.

121
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:46,052
And obviously if this guy
up here wins the race.

122
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:48,033
Or maybe I should
say this girl.

123
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:52,063
If she wins the race, then the
fertilized egg will develop

124
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,080
into a female.

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,019
If this sperm wins the race,
then the fertilized egg will

126
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,001
develop into a male.

127
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,087
And the reason why I said it's
ironic is throughout history,

128
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:04,064
and probably the most famous
example of this

129
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,035
is Henry the VIII.

130
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:09,089


131
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,049
I mean it's not just the
case with kings.

132
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:14,094
It's probably true, because most
of our civilization is

133
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:18,007
male dominated, that you've had
these men who are obsessed

134
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:20,072
with producing a male
heir to kind of take

135
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:21,083
over the family name.

136
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,074
And, in the case of Henry the
VIII, take over a country.

137
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:28,022
And they become very
disappointed and they tend to

138
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:31,036
blame their wives when the wives
keep producing females,

139
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,013
but it's all their fault.

140
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:35,023
Henry the VIII, I mean
the most famous case

141
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:36,048
was with Ann Boleyn.

142
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,016


143
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:44,062
I'm not an expert here, but the
general notion is that he

144
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:47,024
became upset with her that she
wasn't producing a male heir.

145
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:51,006
And then he found a reason
to get her essentially

146
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:55,013
decapitated, even though
it was all his fault.

147
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,070


148
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,031
He was maybe producing a lot
more sperm that looked like

149
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:03,002
that than was looking
like this.

150
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,067
He eventually does produce a
male heir so he was-- and if

151
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:09,063
we assume that it was his
child-- then obviously he was

152
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:12,027
producing some of these, but for
the most part, it was all

153
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:13,031
Henry the VIII's fault.

154
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,035
So that's why I say there's a
little bit of irony here.

155
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,079
Is that the people doing the
blame are the people to blame

156
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,088
for the lack of a male heir.

157
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:24,076
Now one question that might
immediately pop up in your

158
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:29,027
head is, Sal, is everything on
these chromosomes related to

159
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:32,097
just our sex-determining traits
or are there other

160
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,050
stuff on them?

161
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,039
So let me draw some
chromosomes.

162
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,093
So let's say that's an X
chromosome and this is a Y

163
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,072
chromosome.

164
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:47,000
Now the X chromosome, it does
code for a lot more things,

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,075
although it is kind of
famously gene poor.

166
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:55,072
It codes for on the order
of 1,500 genes.

167
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:59,063
And the Y chromosome, it's the
most gene poor of all the

168
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,068
chromosomes.

169
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:05,039
It only codes for on the
order of 78 genes.

170
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,016
I just looked this up, but who
knows if it's exactly 78.

171
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:12,002
But what it tells you is it does
very little other than

172
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,069
determining what
the gender is.

173
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,064
And the way it determines that,
it does have one gene on

174
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,095
it called the SRY gene.

175
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,093
You don't have to know that.

176
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:32,095
SRY, that plays a role in the
development of testes or the

177
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,075
male sexual organ.

178
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:38,032
So if you have this around, this
gene right here can start

179
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:40,066
coding for things that will
eventually lead to the

180
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,017
development of the testicles.

181
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,011
And if you don't have that
around, that won't happen, so

182
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,075
you'll end up with a female.

183
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:48,050
And I'm making gross
oversimplifications here.

184
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,071
But everything I've dealt with
so far, OK, this clearly plays

185
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:53,088
a role in determining sex.

186
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:58,038
But you do have other traits
on these genes.

187
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,091
And the famous cases all deal
with specific disorders.

188
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:05,055
So, for example, color
blindness.

189
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:08,052
The genes, or the mutations
I should say.

190
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:15,054
So the mutations that cause
color blindness.

191
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:21,000
Red-green color blindness, which
I did in green, which is

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,025
maybe a little bit
inappropriate.

193
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:28,024
Color blindness and
also hemophilia.

194
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:30,096
This is an inability of
your blood to clot.

195
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,084
Actually, there's several
types of hemophilia.

196
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:35,005
But hemophilia is an
inability for your

197
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:36,083
blood to clot properly.

198
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,093
And both of these are mutations
on the X chromosome.

199
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:45,059


200
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,011
And they're recessive
mutations.

201
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,090


202
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,014
So what does that mean?

203
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:54,036
It means both of your X
chromosomes have to have--

204
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:57,012
let's take the case for
hemophilia-- both of your X

205
00:09:57,012 --> 00:10:00,046
chromosomes have to have the
hemophilia mutation in order

206
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:04,017
for you to show the phenotype
of having hemophilia.

207
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:08,008
So, for example, if there's a
woman, and let's say this is

208
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,036
her genotype.

209
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:11,061
She has one regular X chromosome
and then she has

210
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:15,020
one X chromosome that has
the-- I'll put a little

211
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,058
superscript there for
hemophilia-- she has the

212
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:20,050
hemophilia mutation.

213
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,087
She's just going to
be a carrier.

214
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:26,048
Her phenotype right here is
going to be no hemophilia.

215
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:29,095


216
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,046
She'll have no problem
clotting her blood.

217
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:36,003
The only way that a woman could
be a hemophiliac is if

218
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,090
she gets two versions of
this, because this

219
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,015
is a recessive mutation.

220
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:42,023


221
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:49,050
Now this individual will
have hemophilia.

222
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,065
Now men, they only have
one X chromosome.

223
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:57,099
So for a man to exhibit
hemophilia, to have this

224
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:00,062
phenotype, he just needs
it only on the one X

225
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:03,052
chromosome he has.

226
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,003
And then the other one's
a Y chromosome.

227
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:07,098


228
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:11,014
So this man will have
hemophilia.

229
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:14,050
So a natural question should be
arising is, hey, you know

230
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,012
this guy-- let's just say that
this is a relatively

231
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:22,021
infrequent mutation that arises
on an X chromosome--

232
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:25,096
the question is who's more
likely to have hemophilia?

233
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:27,001
A male or a female?

234
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,062
All else equal, who's more
likely to have it?

235
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:33,049
Well if this is a relatively
infrequent allele, a female,

236
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:35,063
in order to display it, has
to get two versions of it.

237
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:40,039
So let's say that the frequency
of it-- and I looked

238
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,036
it up before this video--
roughly they say between 1 in

239
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,046
5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit
hemophilia.

240
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:51,001
So let's say that the allele
frequency of this is 1 in

241
00:11:51,001 --> 00:12:00,012
7,000, the frequency of Xh, the
hemophilia version of the

242
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,010
X chromosome.

243
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,049
And that's why 1 in 7,000 men
display it, because it's

244
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,019
completely determined whether--
there's a 1 in 7,000

245
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,080
chance that this X chromosome
they get is

246
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,025
the hemophilia version.

247
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,012
Who cares what the Y chromosome
they get is, cause

248
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:17,012
that essentially doesn't code at
all for the blood clotting

249
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,070
factors and all of the things
that drive hemophilia.

250
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,087
Now, for a woman to get

251
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:23,013
hemophilia, what has to happen?

252
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:26,012
She has to have two X
chromosomes with the mutation.

253
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:31,001
Well the probability of each of
them having the mutation is

254
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,062
1 in 7,000.

255
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:38,011
So the probability of her having
hemophilia is 1 in

256
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:46,014
7,000 times 1 in 7,000, or
that's 1 in what, 49 million.

257
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:49,078
So as you can imagine, the
incidence of hemophilia in

258
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,087
women is much lower than
the incidence of

259
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,022
hemophilia in men.

260
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,060
And in general for any
sex-linked trait, if it's

261
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,099
recessive, if it's a recessive
sex-linked trait, which means

262
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:03,052
men, if they have it, they're
going to show it, because they

263
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:06,074
don't have another X chromosome
to dominate it.

264
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,063
Or for women to show
it, she has to have

265
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:09,087
both versions of it.

266
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:18,014
The incidence in men is going to
be, so let's say that m is

267
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,005
the incidence in men.

268
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:23,072


269
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,097
I'm spelling badly.

270
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:29,055


271
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:33,033
Then the incidence in
women will be what?

272
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:36,003
You could view this as the
allele frequency of that

273
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:38,000
mutation on the X chromosome.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,011
So women have to get
two versions of it.

275
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:42,067
So the woman's frequency
is m squared.

276
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,067
And you might say, hey, that
looks like a bigger number.

277
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,027
I'm squaring it.

278
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:48,061
But you have to remember that
these numbers, the frequency

279
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,025
is less than 1, so in the
case of hemophilia,

280
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:53,020
that was 1 in 7,000.

281
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,067
So if you square 1 in 7,000,
you get 1 in 49 million.

282
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:01,024
Anyway, hopefully you found that
interesting and now you

283
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:05,021
know how we all become
men and women.

284
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:11,047
And even better you know whom to
blame when some of these, I

285
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:16,034
guess, male-focused parents
are having trouble

286
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,059
getting their son.

287
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,033

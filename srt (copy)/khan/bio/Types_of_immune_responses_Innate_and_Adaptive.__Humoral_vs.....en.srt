1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,050


2
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,033
In the last video, we
talked a little bit

3
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:04,065
about the immune system.

4
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:09,092
In that video, we focused on the
nonspecific or the innate

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,069
immune system.

6
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:11,094
So let me write that.

7
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:17,010


8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,030
And even in the nonspecific
immune system, we subdivided

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,087
that into kind of the
first line barriers.

10
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:30,003
And those were things like the
skin, or the stomach acid, or

11
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,042
the acidity of the oils on
the outside of your skin.

12
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,064
These are just natural barriers
to not allowing

13
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:38,021
things inside of your body, but
then once they get in-- so

14
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,052
you can almost imagine
these were the

15
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:42,082
first line of defense.

16
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:45,072
And then you had your second
line of defense, but these are

17
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:48,096
still nonspecific-- and when we
say nonspecific, it means

18
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:51,067
that they don't necessarily know
what type of virus, what

19
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,046
type of protein, what
type of bacteria.

20
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,042
They just know that this
thing looks shady.

21
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,025
Let me eat it up.

22
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:56,095
Let me kill it.

23
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:59,045
Let me have an inflammatory
response.

24
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,071
So in there, we said, well,
there's an inflammatory

25
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:06,023
response, which I'm actually
going to talk about after we

26
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:09,046
do videos on the specific
immune system.

27
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:11,057
You have your inflammatory
response, which really just

28
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:14,098
gets things to where the action
is at and then you also

29
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:20,006
have your phagocytes, which
are these cells that are

30
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,081
engulfing things.

31
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,093
And just so you know, all the
phagocytes that we talked

32
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:29,006
about in the last video, these
are all instances of white

33
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,053
blood cells or leukocytes.

34
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:35,037


35
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:38,067
These phagocytes right here,
these are all-- I talk about

36
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:43,031
dendritic cells and macrophages
and neutrophils.

37
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,090
These were all white
blood cells.

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,073
These weren't all the kinds
of white blood cells.

39
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,031
We're about to talk about more--
and the other word for

40
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,092
white blood cell is
also leukocyte.

41
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:55,056


42
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,062
So that is nonspecific.

43
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,065
Well, one, it just doesn't let
you in, but then when you're

44
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,092
in, it says, hey, you're
just shady.

45
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,087
I'm going to eat you up.

46
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,098
I have receptors.

47
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:06,017
You have some double stranded
DNA floating around.

48
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:08,003
Only viruses have double
strand DNA.

49
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:08,094
I'm going to eat you up.

50
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,055
I don't know what type
of virus you are.

51
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,040
I don't know if I've seen
you before or not.

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,000
That's why it's nonspecific.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,012
Now the really interesting
thing about our immune

54
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:22,024
system-- and this nonspecific,
this exists across many, many,

55
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:28,028
many species and types of
organisms. But the specific is

56
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:32,002
kind of a-- it's thought to
be a newer adaptation.

57
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,044
What I'm going to talk about is
the specific immune system

58
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:35,070
that's particular to humans.

59
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:41,012


60
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,046
That's our other
classification.

61
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:45,006
Let me do it like that.

62
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:50,006
So then you have your specific--
or you can imagine

63
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,068
it's an adaptive
immune system.

64
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,084
You've probably heard
of things like that.

65
00:02:54,084 --> 00:03:00,068
I have resistance to that
bacteria or that virus.

66
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:03,080
So this is adaptive.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
And it's really all based on
having exposure to things.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,058
And within the specific immune
system, we talked a little--

69
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:16,059
when we talked about the antigen
presenting molecules

70
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,081
that phagocytes do-- that
plays a role in this.

71
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,043
We're going to go into more
detail, but I don't want to

72
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:21,022
confuse you.

73
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:24,030
But the main actors here are
called lymphocytes, not to be

74
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,056
confused with leukocytes--
because they still are

75
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:28,018
leukocytes.

76
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,043
So let me write this down.

77
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:38,093


78
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,006
These are specific.

79
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:44,018
Phagocytes, for the most part,
are nonspecific, but both of

80
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,086
these are white blood cells.

81
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,062
Lymphocytes are another
type of white

82
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,084
blood cell or leukocyte.

83
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:53,015
Don't want to confuse you with
this convoluted diagram, but I

84
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,050
just want to make the
terminology clear.

85
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,034
When someone talks about a
white blood cell, they're

86
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,037
really just talking about a set
of cells that when people

87
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,009
first tried to separate the
components of blood-- you'd

88
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,046
have your red blood cells that
would kind of settle in the

89
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,003
bottom, then you'd have this
layer of white frothy stuff in

90
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,084
the middle that was really made
of white blood cells, and

91
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,065
then on the top, you had the
fluid, the plasma from your

92
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:13,000
blood, kind of the
watery part.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,028
So that's where the name came
from, but they have different

94
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,035
roles, but they interact
with each other.

95
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:24,088
Now lymphocytes can be divided
into B lymphocytes, usually

96
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:28,037
referred to as B cells--
and T lymphocytes.

97
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:36,043


98
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,035
And the B and T just come from
where they're developed.

99
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:42,081
B lymphocytes were first
recognized in

100
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,081
the bursa of Fabricius.

101
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,081
That's why it's called B.

102
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,051
That's actually a part of birds
that participate in the

103
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:49,041
immune system.

104
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,051
And so the B came from bursa,
but B also applies to the

105
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:56,037
human immune system because it's
produced in bone marrow.

106
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:58,079
So that might be an easier
way to remember.

107
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,092
It's produced in bone marrow.

108
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:08,050
It's developed in bone marrow,
but historically, the B came

109
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,029
from the bursa of Fabricius,
just in case you want to know.

110
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,042
But it's easy to remember.

111
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:14,072
The B could also stand for bone
marrow because that's

112
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:16,000
where it's produced.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,049
T lymphocytes actually do start
off in the bone marrow,

114
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:22,075
but they mature and become what
they are in the thymus.

115
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:24,011
So that's where the
T comes from.

116
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:26,077


117
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:29,012
Now in this video, I'm going
to focus just on the B

118
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,025
lymphocytes-- because frankly,
if I focused on everything, it

119
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,052
would be an hour-long video.

120
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:36,056
But the B lymphocytes frankly on
some level-- well, I don't

121
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:39,023
want to pick and choose
favorites, but something in my

122
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:41,093
brain-- I just really like
the B lymphocytes.

123
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:44,056
So the B lymphocytes participate
in what's called

124
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,081
the humoral response.

125
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:49,018


126
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:51,005
And I'll tell you what humoral
means in a second.

127
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:58,036


128
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:00,081
You'll see that T lymphocytes
participate in what's called

129
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,091
the cell mediated response and
we're going to do that in a

130
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,016
future video.

131
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:07,041


132
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,076
They actually do certain classes
of T lymphocytes.

133
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:15,047
We'll see that there are helper
T cells and there are

134
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,094
cytotoxic T cells.

135
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:19,037
I know it's all very confusing
the first time you see it, but

136
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:21,018
that's why I just want
to focus on just

137
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:22,018
this part right here.

138
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:25,024
We're going to see in the future
that the helper T cells

139
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,070
play a role in amplifying
and really activating

140
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,039
this humoral response.

141
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,054
But a simple way to think about
the difference between

142
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,048
the humoral response and the
cell mediated response is,

143
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,047
when I get infected--
let's say I get

144
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,048
infected by a virus, right?

145
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:45,061


146
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:48,023
At first, when a virus comes
into my system, it's just

147
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:51,070
floating around in the
fluids in my system.

148
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,032
The fluids of our system--
that's really what humoral

149
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:59,080
responds to, into the humoral
fluids of your body.

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,005
So you have your viruses.

151
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:05,005


152
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:08,026
These are little viruses
floating around.

153
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:11,074
So while they're floating around
and they're not sitting

154
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:17,070
inside of cells, that's where
the humoral response

155
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,060
can come into play.

156
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,006
Same thing if we have little
bacteria floating around and

157
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,086
they haven't infiltrated
cells yet.

158
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:27,031
They're just floating around in
the fluid, then the humoral

159
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:31,012
response can be useful
for that.

160
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:37,073
Now if all of a sudden, these
guys have infiltrated cells--

161
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:40,057
so if the cells are now infected
with the virus and

162
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:43,056
they're producing the viruses
using the mechanisms of the

163
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:46,093
cell to produce more, then all
of a sudden we have to be a

164
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:49,094
little bit more sophisticated
in how we deal with these

165
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,018
cells and how we deal with the
viruses because they're not

166
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:53,057
just going to be floating
around anymore.

167
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,023
We probably want to just kill
this cell even though it was

168
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:59,000
one of our own, but now it's
helping to make viruses.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,025
Or maybe it's been colonized
by bacteria.

170
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,049
So in either case, you
want to kill this.

171
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,000
And we'll talk more about that
in the cell mediating.

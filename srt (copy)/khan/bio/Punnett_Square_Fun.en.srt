1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,063


2
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:04,075
In the last video, I drew this
grid in order to understand

3
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,017
better the different
combinations of alleles I

4
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:09,040
could get from my
mom or my dad.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,031
And this grid that I drew is
called a Punnett square.

6
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:17,000


7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,064
And I looked up what Punnett
means, and it turns out, and

8
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:24,005
this might be the biggest
takeaway from this video, that

9
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,037
when you go to the farmers'
market or you go to the

10
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:29,083
produce and you see those little
baskets, you see those

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:33,036
little baskets that often you'll
see maybe strawberries

12
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:35,075
or blueberries sitting in, they
have this little grid

13
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,075
here, right there.

14
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:39,014
Sometimes grapes are in them,
and you have a bunch of

15
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:42,053
strawberries in them
like that.

16
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:45,077
That green basket
is a punnett.

17
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:46,059
That's a punnett.

18
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,050
Apparently, in some countries,
they call it a punnett.

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,046
I think England's one of them,
and you UK viewers can correct

20
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,018
me if I'm wrong.

21
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:56,064
And so I guess that's where
the inspiration comes for

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,029
calling these Punnett squares,
that these are kind of these

23
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:02,038
little green baskets that
you can throw different

24
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,064
combinations of genotypes in.

25
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,014
And these Punnett squares
aren't just useful.

26
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:10,078
If you're talking about crossing
two hybrids, this is

27
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:14,014
called a monohybrid cross
because you are crossing two

28
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:15,096
hybrids for only one trait.

29
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:19,037
It could be useful for a whole
set of different types of

30
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:25,000
crosses between two reproducing
organisms. It

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,045
doesn't even have to be a
situation where one thing is

32
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,042
dominating another.

33
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:31,031
Let's do a bunch of these,
just to make you

34
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,059
familiar with the idea.

35
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,073
So let's say you have a mom.

36
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:38,090
So instead of doing two hybrids,
let's say the mom--

37
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,015
I'll keep using the blue-eyed,
brown-eyed analogy just

38
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,082
because we're already reasonably
useful to it.

39
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:48,067
Let's say that she's homozygous
dominant.

40
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:56,015
And let's say that the dad is a
heterozygote, so he's got a

41
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,001
brown and he's got a blue.

42
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,037
And we want to know the
different combinations of

43
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,040
genotypes that one of their
children might have. So what

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,039
we do is we draw a Punnett
square again.

45
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:13,055
Let me draw a grid here and
draw a grid right there.

46
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,071
And up here, we'll write the
different genes that mom can

47
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,050
contribute, and here, we'll
write the different genes that

48
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,096
dad can contribute, or the
different alleles.

49
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,077
I didn't want to write gene.

50
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:26,015
I wanted to write dad.

51
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:30,061
So the mom in either case is
either going to contribute

52
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:35,015
this big B brown allele from
one of the homologous

53
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:37,031
chromosomes, or on the other
homologous, well, they have

54
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,043
the same allele so she's
going to contribute

55
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,084
that one to her child.

56
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:48,090
The dad could contribute this
one, that big brown-eyed-- the

57
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,022
capital B allele for brown eyes
or the lowercase b for

58
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,096
blue eyes, either one.

59
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:58,072
So the different combinations
that might happen, an

60
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:03,008
offspring could get both of
these brown alleles from one

61
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,021
copy from both parents.

62
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,006
This could also happen where you
get this brown allele from

63
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:11,075
the dad and then the other brown
allele from the mom, or

64
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:15,081
you could get a brown allele
from the mom and a blue-eyed

65
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:19,008
allele from the dad, or you
could get the other brown-eyed

66
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:22,024
allele from the mom, right?

67
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:25,024
When the mom has this, she has
two chromosomes, homologous

68
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:25,080
chromosomes.

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,013
Each of them have the same
brown allele on them.

70
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:32,000
They both have that same brown
allele, so I could get the

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
other one from my mom and
still get this blue-eyed

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,000
allele from my dad.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,006
So if you said what's the
probability of having a

74
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:44,013
blue-eyed child, assuming that
blue eyes are recessive?

75
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,081
And remember, this
is a phenotype.

76
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:48,033
These particular combinations
are genotypes.

77
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,086
Well, in order to have blue
eyes, you have to be

78
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,025
homozygous recessive.

79
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,043
You have to have two
lowercase b's.

80
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:56,049
So what's the probability
of having this?

81
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,040
Well, there are no combinations
that result in

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,033
that, so there's a 0%
probability of having two

83
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,050
blue-eyed children.

84
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,016
What's the probability
of having a

85
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:09,084
homozygous dominant child?

86
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,059
Let me write that.

87
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:17,008
A homozygous dominant.

88
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,086
And now we're looking
at the genotype.

89
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,058
We care about the
specific alleles

90
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,074
that that child inherits.

91
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:24,087
Well, which of these are
homozygous dominant?

92
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:27,052
Well, you have this one right
here and you have that one

93
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:31,019
right there, and so two of
the four equally likely

94
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,076
combinations are homozygous
dominant, so

95
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:37,008
you have a 50% shot.

96
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:38,043
And we can do these
Punnett squares.

97
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:42,080
They don't even have to be for
situations where one trait is

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,024
necessarily dominant
on the other.

99
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,062
For example, you could have the
situation-- it's called

100
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:48,087
incomplete dominance.

101
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:59,032


102
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:05,064
Let's say you have two traits
for color in a flower.

103
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:10,025
You could have red flowers or
you could have white flowers.

104
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:14,016


105
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:23,017
And let's say I were to cross
a parent flower that has the

106
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:28,012
genotype capital R-- I'll just
make it in a capital W.

107
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:31,011
So that could be the mom or the
dad, although the analogy

108
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:32,080
breaks down a little bit with
parents, although there is a

109
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,017
male and female, although
sometimes on the same plant.

110
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,068
And let's say the other plant
is also a red and white.

111
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:42,049
The other plant has
a red allele and

112
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,001
also has a white allele.

113
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,087
So what are the different
possibilities?

114
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:50,019
Well, we just draw our
Punnett square again.

115
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:53,082
Let me draw our little grid.

116
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:58,071
So the child could inherit both
of these red alleles.

117
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:02,068
He could inherit this white
allele and then this red

118
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:06,072
allele, so this red one and then
this white one, right?

119
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:09,005
That's that right there
and that red one

120
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,029
is that right there.

121
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,018
Or it could inherit this red one
from-- let's say this is

122
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:18,081
the mom plant and then the
white allele from the dad

123
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,099
plant, so that's that
one right there.

124
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,066
Or you could inherit
both white alleles.

125
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,070
What I said when I went into
this, and I wrote it at the

126
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,056
top right here, is we're
studying a situation dealing

127
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,030
with incomplete dominance.

128
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,066
So what does that mean?

129
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:36,054
Well, that means you might
actually have mixing or

130
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:41,012
blending of the traits when
you actually look at them.

131
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,080
So if this was complete
dominance, if red was dominant

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,032
to white, then you'd say, OK,
all of these guys are going to

133
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:49,076
be red and only this guy right
here is going to be white, so

134
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,025
you have a one in four
probability to being white.

135
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:57,012
But let's say that a
heterozygous genotype-- so let

136
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,052
me write that down.

137
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:05,036
Let's say when you have one R
allele and one white allele,

138
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,014
that this doesn't
result in red.

139
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,039
This results in pink.

140
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,066


141
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,086
So this is what blending is.

142
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:15,031
It's kind of a mixture
of the two.

143
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:19,064
So if I said if these these two
plants were to reproduce,

144
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:24,006
and the traits for red and white
petals, I guess we could

145
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:28,017
say, are incomplete dominant,
or incompletely dominant, or

146
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:32,083
they blend, and if I were to say
what's the probability of

147
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,064
having a pink plant?

148
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:37,057
And now when I'm talking
about pink, this, of

149
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,013
course, is a phenotype.

150
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,049
So the probability of pink,
well, let's look at the

151
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,093
different combinations.

152
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:45,055
How many of these are pink?

153
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,075
This one is pink and
this is pink.

154
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:52,057
So two are pink of a total
of four equally likely

155
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:59,012
combinations, so it's a 50%
chance that we're pink.

156
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,097
And we could keep doing this
over multiple generations, and

157
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:04,017
say, oh, what happens in the
second and third and the

158
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,082
fourth generation?

159
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:07,082
Actually, we could even have
a situation where we have

160
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:11,018
multiple different alleles, and
I'll use almost a kind of

161
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,068
a more realistic example.

162
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:15,068
I'll use blood types
as an example.

163
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:19,052
So there's three potential
alleles for blood type.

164
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:22,014


165
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:26,087
You can have a blood type A, you
could have a blood type B,

166
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:28,065
or you could have
a blood type O.

167
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:32,058


168
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:35,023
What happens is you have a
combination here between

169
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,084
codominance and recessive
genes.

170
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,044
And I'm going to show you what
I talk about when we do the

171
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,025
Punnett squares.

172
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,023
Maybe I'll stick to one color
here because I think you're

173
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,052
getting the idea.

174
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:47,042
So let's say I have a
parent who is AB.

175
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:50,082
So that means that they have
on one of their homologous

176
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:53,098
chromosomes, they have the A
allele, and on the other one,

177
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:55,015
they have the B allele.

178
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:56,072
That's what AB means.

179
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:59,024
So the phenotype is
the genotype.

180
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:00,026
They're codominant.

181
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:02,023
They both express themselves.

182
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:03,037
They don't necessarily blend.

183
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:04,029
They both express.

184
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:06,057
That's an AB blood type.

185
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:07,038
Let me write this right here.

186
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:10,074
This is AB blood type.

187
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:13,049


188
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:23,020
And then the other parent is--
let's say that they are fully

189
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,041
an A blood type.

190
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,004
Let's say they're
an A blood type.

191
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:30,097
Let's say their phenotype is an
A blood type-- I hope I'm

192
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:34,019
not confusing you-- but their
genotype is that they have one

193
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,035
allele that's an A and their
other allele that's an O.

194
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,020
So this is what's interesting
about blood types.

195
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,022
It's a mixture.

196
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:43,071
O is recessive.

197
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:47,004
O is recessive, while these
guys are codominant.

198
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,064
So if you have either of
these guys with an

199
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:50,050
O, these guys dominate.

200
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,013
If you have them together, then
your blood type is AB.

201
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:56,017
So what are all the different
combinations for these for

202
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:57,058
this couple here?

203
00:09:57,058 --> 00:10:02,036


204
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:06,057
Well, you could get this A and
that A, so you get an A from

205
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:10,099
your mom and you get an A from
your dad right there.

206
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:15,001
And clearly in this case, your
phenotype, you will have an A

207
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,000
blood type in this situation.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,096
You could get the A from your
dad and you could get the B

209
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:25,058
from your mom, in which case
you have an AB blood type.

210
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:31,002
You could get the A from your
mom and the O from your dad,

211
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:34,036
in which case you have an A
blood type because this

212
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,092
dominates that.

213
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:40,076
Or you could get the B from
your-- I dont want to

214
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:42,008
introduce arbitrary colors.

215
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:49,029
You could get the B from your
mom, that's this one, or the O

216
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,049
from your dad.

217
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,049
No, once again, I introduced
a different color.

218
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,091
And this is a B blood type.

219
00:10:54,091 --> 00:11:02,064
So if I said what's the
probability of having an AA

220
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:05,098
blood type?

221
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:08,046
And once again, we're talking
about a phenotype here.

222
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:10,022
So which of these are
an A blood type?

223
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:13,079
This one definitely is,
because it's AA.

224
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,063
If you have two A alleles,
you'll definitely have an A

225
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:20,075
blood type, but you also have
an A blood type phenotype if

226
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:23,001
you have an A and then an O.

227
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,042
O is recessive.

228
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:28,069
So this is also going to
be an A blood type.

229
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:36,000
So these are both A blood, so
there's a 50% chance, because

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,087
two of the four combinations
show us an A blood type.

231
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,057
And you could do all of the
different combinations.

232
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:44,095
You say, well, how do you
have an O blood type?

233
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:48,045
Well, both of your parents
will have to carry

234
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,051
at least one O.

235
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:54,029
So, for example, to have a--
that would've been possible if

236
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:58,009
maybe instead of an AB, this
right here was an O, then this

237
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,037
combination would've been
two O's right there.

238
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,065
So hopefully, that gives you
an idea of how a Punnett

239
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:05,096
square can be useful, and it can
even be useful when we're

240
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:09,011
talking about more
than one trait.

241
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,097
So let's go to our situation
that I talked about before

242
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:18,003
where I said you have little b
is equal to blue eyes, and

243
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,078
we're assuming that that's
recessive, and you have big B

244
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,052
is equal to brown eyes,
and we're assuming

245
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,077
that this is dominant.

246
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:29,098


247
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,034
And let's say we have
another trait.

248
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:34,082


249
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:37,075
I introduced that tooth
trait before.

250
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:40,077
So let's say little t is
equal to small teeth.

251
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:43,078


252
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,028
I don't know what type of
bizarre organism I'm talking

253
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:48,030
about, although I think
I would fall into

254
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,083
the big tooth camp.

255
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,033
Let's say big T is equal
to big teeth.

256
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:56,000


257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,033
So an individual can have--
for example, I might be

258
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:05,004
heterozygous brown eyes, so my
genotype might be heterozygous

259
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:10,074
for brown eyes and then
homozygous dominant for teeth.

260
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,050
So this might be my genotype.

261
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,067
And the phenotype for this one
would be a big-toothed,

262
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,080
brown-eyed person, right?

263
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,082
Let me make that clear.

264
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,015
This is big tooth phenotype.

265
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:23,025


266
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,012
And this is the phenotype.

267
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,075
What you see is brown eyes.

268
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:30,069
A big-toothed, brown-eyed
person.

269
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:35,078
Now if we assume that the genes
that code for teeth or

270
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,062
eye color are on different
chromosomes, and this is a key

271
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:44,015
assumption, we can say that
they assort independently.

272
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,091
Let me write that down:
independent assortment.

273
00:13:46,091 --> 00:14:00,005


274
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:05,030
So this is a case where if I
were look at my chromosomes,

275
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,023
let's say this is one homologous
pair, maybe we call

276
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:12,005
that homologous pair 1, and
let's say I have another

277
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:16,026
homologous pair, and obviously
we have 23 of these, but let's

278
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:23,084
say this is homologous pair 2
right here, if the eye color

279
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:30,026
gene is here and here, remember
both homologous

280
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:32,036
chromosomes code for
the same genes.

281
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,005
They might have different
versions.

282
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,015
Those are alleles.

283
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:41,072
And if teeth are over here,
they will assort

284
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,051
independently.

285
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:46,090
So after meiosis occurs to
produce the gametes, the

286
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,037
offspring might get this
chromosome or a copy of that

287
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:55,016
chromosome for eye color and
might get a copy of this

288
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:59,005
chromosome for teeth
size or tooth size.

289
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,040
Or it could go the other way.

290
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,022
Maybe another offspring gets
this one, this chromosome for

291
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,059
eye color, and then this
chromosome for teeth color and

292
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,057
gets the other version
of the allele.

293
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:13,067
So because they're on different
chromosomes, there's

294
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:16,088
no linkage between if you
inherit this one, whether you

295
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:19,099
inherit big teeth, whether
you're going to inherit small

296
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:21,085
brown eyes or blue eyes.

297
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:24,012
Now, if they were on the same
chromosomee-- let's say the

298
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:26,040
situation where they are
on the same chromosome.

299
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,035
So let me pick another
trait: hair color.

300
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:34,012


301
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:38,017
Let's say the gene for hair
color is on chromosome 1, so

302
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,025
let's say hair color, the
gene is there and there.

303
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,005
These might be different
versions of hair color,

304
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,095
different alleles, but the
genes are on that same

305
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,086
chromosome.

306
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:50,051
In this situation, if someone
gets-- let's say if this is

307
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:55,020
blue eyes here and this is blond
hair, then these are

308
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,090
going always travel together.

309
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,037
You're not going to have these
assort independently.

310
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:02,000
And these are called
linked traits.

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,055
Let me highlight that.

312
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:07,073
So these right there, those
are linked traits.

313
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:10,017
But for a second, and we'll talk
more about linked traits,

314
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,013
and especially sex-linked traits
in probably the next

315
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,051
video or a few videos from now,
but let's assume that

316
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:19,000
we're talking about traits that
assort independently, and

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,014
we cross two hybrids.

318
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,035
So this is called a
dihybrid cross.

319
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:26,060
Very fancy word, but it just
gives you an idea of the power

320
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,016
of the Punnett square.

321
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:35,049
So let's say both parents are--
so they're both hybrids,

322
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:41,073
which means that they both have
the dominant brown-eye

323
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:46,040
allele and they have the
recessive blue-eye allele, and

324
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,036
they both have the dominant
big-tooth gene and they both

325
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,057
have the recessive little
tooth gene.

326
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:57,029
So this is the genotype
for both parents.

327
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,044
Both parents are dihybrid.

328
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:03,098
They're hybrids for both
genes, both parents.

329
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:04,098
What are all the different

330
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:06,092
combinations for their children?

331
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,029
And I could have done this
without dihybrids.

332
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,049
I could have made one of them
homozygous for one of the

333
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:15,000
traits and a hybrid for the
other, and I could have done

334
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,020
every different combination,
but I'll do the dihybrid,

335
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,077
because it leads to a lot of our
variety, and you'll often

336
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:22,063
see this in classes.

337
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:29,016
So if I'm talking about the mom,
what are the different

338
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:32,093
combinations of genes that
the mom can contribute?

339
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:37,076
Well, the mom could contribute
the brown-- so for each of

340
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:41,039
these traits, she can only
contribute one of the alleles.

341
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,066
So she could contribute this
brown right here and then the

342
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:51,067
big yellow T, so this is one
combination, or she could

343
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:59,014
contribute the big brown and
then the little yellow t, or

344
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,067
she can contribute
the blue-eyed

345
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,016
allele and the big T.

346
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,003
So these are all the different
combinations that she could

347
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,000
contribute.

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,021
And then the final combination
is this allele and that

349
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:16,036
allele, so the blue eyes
and the small teeth.

350
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:18,018
So that's from mom.

351
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:21,004
And, of course, dad could
contribute the same different

352
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:23,090
combinations because dad
has the same genotype.

353
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,005
Let me write that down.

354
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,025
Let me just write it like this
so I don't have to keep

355
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,013
switching colors.

356
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:33,084
Actually, I want to make them
a little closer together

357
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:37,049
because I'm going to run
out of space otherwise.

358
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,086
Nope.

359
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,040
Let me do it like that.

360
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,031
OK, brown eyes, so the dad could
contribute the big teeth

361
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:50,019
or the little teeth, z along
with the brown-eyed gene, or

362
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:54,050
he could contribute the
blue-eyed gene, the blue-eyed

363
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,071
allele in combination with the
big teeth or the yellow teeth.

364
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,094
Not the yellow teeth,
the little teeth.

365
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:02,094
That would be a different gene
for yellow teeth or maybe

366
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:04,059
that's an environmental
factor.

367
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,026
So these are all the different
combinations that can occur

368
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,052
for their offspring.

369
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:12,078
So let's draw-- call this maybe
a super Punnett square,

370
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,025
because we're now dealing
with, instead of four

371
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:20,002
combinations, we have
16 combinations.

372
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:24,016
It looks like I ran out
of ink right there.

373
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:28,023
It's strange why--
16 combinations.

374
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:32,007
Let me write that out.

375
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:33,085
Something's wrong
with my tablet.

376
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:34,078
Maybe there's something weird.

377
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:38,034
OK, so there's 16 different
combinations, and let's write

378
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,086
them all out, and I'll just
stay in one maybe neutral

379
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:42,049
color so I don't have
to keep switching.

380
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:47,050
I could get this combination,
so this brown eyes from my

381
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,041
mom, brown eyes from my dad
allele, so its brown-brown,

382
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,050
and then big teeth from both.

383
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,086
I could have this combination,
so I have capital B

384
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,082
and a capital B.

385
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:02,057
And then I have a capital
T and a lowercase t.

386
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:05,000
And then let's just keep
moving forward.

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,063
So I could get a capital B and a
lowercase B with a capital T

388
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:16,006
and a capital T, a big B,
lowercase B, capital T

389
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,034
lowercase t.

390
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:18,077
And I'm just going to go through
these super-fast

391
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:21,092
because it's going to take
forever, so capital B from

392
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:26,013
here, capital B from there;
capital T, lowercase t from

393
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:32,015
here; capital B from each and
then lowercase t from each.

394
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:35,022
You have a capital B and then
a lowercase b from that one,

395
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:39,075
and then a capital T from the
mom, lowercase t from the dad.

396
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:42,006
Hopefully, you're not getting
too tired here.

397
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:45,073
And so then you have the capital
B from your dad and

398
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:48,005
then lowercase b
from your mom.

399
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,098
Two lowercase t's-- actually
let me just pause and fill

400
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:53,031
these in because I don't want
to waste your time.

401
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:56,040
There I have saved you some time
and I've filled in every

402
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,075
combination similar to what
happens on many cooking shows.

403
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:01,028
But now that I've filled
in all the different

404
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,084
combinations, we can talk a
little bit about the different

405
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:06,000
phenotypes that might
be expressed from

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,085
this dihybrid cross.

407
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:11,099
For example, how many of these
are going to exhibit brown

408
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:13,061
eyes and big teeth?

409
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,077
So big teeth, brown-eyed kids.

410
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:19,033


411
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,010
Let me write this down here.

412
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:27,019
So if I want big teeth
and brown eyes.

413
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,058


414
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:35,048
All of a sudden, my pen
doesn't-- brown eyes.

415
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,050
So how many are there?

416
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,088
Big teeth and brown eyes.

417
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:42,045
So they're both dominant, so if
you have either a capital B

418
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:45,049
or a capital T in any of them,
you're going to have big teeth

419
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,041
and brown eyes, so this is
big teeth and brown eyes.

420
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,081
Big teeth right here,
brown eyes there.

421
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:54,070
Or maybe I should just say
brown eyes and big teeth

422
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,025
because that's the order that
I wrote it right here.

423
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:59,077
Brown eyes and big teeth, brown
eyes and big teeth.

424
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:01,036
Even though I have a recessive
trait here,

425
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:02,061
the brown eyes dominate.

426
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:05,034
I had a small teeth here, but
the big teeth dominate.

427
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,081
This is brown eyes
and big teeth.

428
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,020
This is brown eyes
and big teeth.

429
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,070
Let's see, this is brown eyes
and big teeth, brown eyes and

430
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,066
big teeth, and let me see,
is that all of them?

431
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,035
Well, no.

432
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,018
This is brown eyes
and little teeth.

433
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:24,084
This is brown eyes and big teeth
right there, and this is

434
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,016
also brown eyes and big teeth.

435
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:29,045
They're heterozygous for each
trait, but both brown eyes and

436
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:32,072
big teeth are dominant, so these
are all phenotypes of

437
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:33,089
brown eyes and big teeth.

438
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,016
So how many of those
do we have?

439
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,074
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

440
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:40,043
eight, nine of those.

441
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:43,002
So we have nine.

442
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:45,083
Nine brown eyes and big teeth.

443
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:49,080
Now, how many do we
have of big teeth?

444
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,063


445
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:55,034
Let me write in a different
color, so let me write brown

446
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:59,088
eyes and little teeth.

447
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:02,081


448
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,034
Something on my pen tablet
doesn't work

449
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:05,055
quite right over there.

450
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:07,097
So brown eyes and
little teeth.

451
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:09,050
So let's see, this
is brown eyes and

452
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,009
little teeth right there.

453
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,026
This is brown eyes and little
teeth right there.

454
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:17,027
This is brown eyes and little
teeth right there.

455
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:19,006
So there's three combinations
of brown

456
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:22,000
eyes and little teeth.

457
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,080
And if I were to say blue eyes,
blue and big teeth, what

458
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,090
are the combinations there?

459
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,075
Well, this is blue eyes and big
teeth, blue eyes and big

460
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:39,065
teeth, blue eyes and big
teeth, so there's three

461
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:41,010
combinations there.

462
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,021
And if I want to be recessive on
both traits, so if I want--

463
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:46,048
let me do this.

464
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:51,049
I want blue eyes, blue
and little teeth.

465
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:54,090


466
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,008
There's only one.

467
00:23:57,008 --> 00:24:00,025
Out of the 16, there's only one
situation where I inherit

468
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:05,049
the recessive trait from both
parents for both traits.

469
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,030
So if you look at this, and
you say, hey, what's the

470
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,092
probability-- there's only
one of that-- what's the

471
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:12,058
probability of having a big
teeth, brown-eyed child?

472
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:14,024
And these are all
the phenotypes.

473
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:17,024
There were 16 different
possibilities here, right?

474
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:20,064
There are 16 squares here, and
9 of them describe the

475
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:22,085
phenotype of big teeth
and brown eyes, so

476
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,042
there's a 9/16 chance.

477
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:28,008
So it's 9 out of 16 chance
of having a big

478
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,082
teeth, brown-eyed child.

479
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:32,008
What's the probability
of a blue-eyed

480
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:33,070
child with little teeth?

481
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,007
1 in 16.

482
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:41,000
So hopefully, in this video,
you've appreciated the power

483
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,052
of the Punnett square, that it's
a useful way to explore

484
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:46,033
every different combination of
all the genes, and it doesn't

485
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,055
have to be only one trait.

486
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:51,044
It can be in this case where
you're doing two traits that

487
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:54,029
show dominance, but they assort
independently because

488
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,083
they're on different
chromosomes.

489
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,055
You could use it-- where'd
I do it over here?

490
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:02,025
You could use it to explore
incomplete dominance when

491
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:04,086
there's blending, where red and
white made pink genes, or

492
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,081
you can even use it when there's
codominance and when

493
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,010
you have multiple alleles,
where it's not just two

494
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,064
different versions of the genes,
there's actually three

495
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:13,073
different versions.

496
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:16,011
So hopefully, you've
enjoyed that.

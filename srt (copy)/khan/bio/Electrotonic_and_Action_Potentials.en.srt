1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033


2
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,014
In the last video, we talked
about how the cell uses a

3
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:08,027
sodium potassium pump and ATP
to maintain its potential

4
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:11,010
difference between the inside
of the cell or the inside of

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,067
the neuron and the outside-- and
in general, the outside is

6
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,033
more positive than the inside.

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:19,028
You have a -70 millivolt
potential difference from the

8
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:21,000
inside to the outside.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,033
It's minus because the outside
is more positive.

10
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,048
Less positive minus more
positive, you're going to get

11
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,073
a negative number
and it's by -70.

12
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:32,088
Now, I said that this was the
foundation for understanding

13
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:35,068
how neurons actually
transmit signals.

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,072
And to understand that, I'll
kind of lay a foundation over

15
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,049
that foundation.

16
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:42,071
I think then just the actual
neuron transmission will make

17
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,075
a lot of sense.

18
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:45,090
Even better, it'll make a lot
of sense why they even have

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,007
these myelin sheaths and these
nodes of Ranvier and why we

20
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,011
have all of these dendrites.

21
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,039
Hopefully it'll all
fit together.

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,025
So there are two types of
ways that kind of a

23
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,015
potential can travel.

24
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,028
So there's two types
of signal transfer.

25
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:02,028
I'll just call it
signal transfer.

26
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,026
I don't know what the
best word for it is.

27
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:06,070
The first one I'll talk
is electrotonic.

28
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,018
It sounds very fancy,
but you'll see it's

29
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,043
a very simple idea.

30
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:21,001


31
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,067
And the other one I'm
going to go over

32
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:25,034
is an action potential.

33
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,076
And they both have their own
positives and negatives in

34
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:32,076
terms of being able to
transmit a signal.

35
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:36,035
We're talking about within the
context of in a cell or across

36
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,026
a cell membrane.

37
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:39,093
Let's understand what
these mean.

38
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:41,078
So let me get my membrane
of a cell.

39
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,031
Let's say it's a nerve cell or
a neuron, just to make it all

40
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,012
fit together in this context.

41
00:01:49,012 --> 00:01:51,004
And we know it's more
positive on the

42
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,029
outside than the inside.

43
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,051
We know that there's a lot of
sodium on the outside or a lot

44
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:58,028
more sodium on the outside
than on the inside.

45
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,031
There might be a little bit.

46
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:05,065
And we know there's a lot more
potassium on the inside than

47
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:08,018
the outside, but we know
generally that the outside is

48
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:11,006
more positive then the inside
because our sodium potassium

49
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,062
pump will pump out three
sodiums for every two

50
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:15,043
potassiums it takes in.

51
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:18,006
Now in the last video, I told
you that there are these

52
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,048
things called-- well, we could
call them a sodium gate.

53
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,081
A sodium ion gate, right?

54
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,043
These are all ions.

55
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,099
They're charged.

56
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,041
Now let's say that there's some
reason, some stimulus--

57
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,066
let me label this.

58
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:35,043


59
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:39,099
That right there is my
sodium ion gate.

60
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,065
And it's in its closed position,
but let's say

61
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,047
something causes it to open.

62
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,069
We'll talk maybe in this video
or maybe this video and the

63
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,033
next about the different
things that

64
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,019
could cause it to open.

65
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,009
Maybe it's some type of stimulus
causes this to open.

66
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:52,090
Actually, there's a whole bunch
of different stimuluses

67
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,047
that would cause it to open.

68
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,037
But let's say it opens.

69
00:02:56,037 --> 00:03:00,056
What's going to happen
if it opens?

70
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,056
So let's say we open it.

71
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,078
Some stimulus opens-- what's
going to happen?

72
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:06,087
We have more positive on the
outside than the inside, so

73
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,046
positive things want
to move in.

74
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:12,040
And this is a sodium gate so
only sodium can go through it.

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,096
So it's kind of a convoluted
protein structure that only

76
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:17,000
sodium can make its
way through.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,084
And on top of that, we have a
lot more sodium on the outside

78
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,050
than on the inside.

79
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,058
So the diffusion gradient's
going to want to make sodium

80
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:23,031
go through it.

81
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:26,065
And the fact that sodium's a
positive ion, the outside is

82
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,027
more positive, they're going to
want to run away from that

83
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,034
positive environment.

84
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,081
So if you open this, you're just
going to have a lot of

85
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,003
sodium ions start to
flood through.

86
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:40,025


87
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:43,018
Now as that happens, what's
going to happen if we go

88
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,050
further down the membrane?

89
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,011
Let's zoom out.

90
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:50,065
So let's say that this is
my membrane right there.

91
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:54,015
Let's say that this is my open
gate right here and that it's

92
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:56,099
open for some reason and a bunch
of sodium is flowing in.

93
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,005
So all of this is becoming
much more positive.

94
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,097
Let's say we had a voltmeter
right here.

95
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:07,022
We're measuring the potential
difference between the inside

96
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:10,041
of the membrane a
and the outside.

97
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,058
Let me do a little chart.

98
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:17,018
I'm going to do the chart
here on my voltmeter.

99
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:20,057
And this is going to be the
potential difference-- or

100
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:26,075
we'll call it the membrane
voltage or the voltage

101
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,000
difference across the
membrane-- and

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,014
let's say this is time.

103
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,045
Let's say I haven't opened
this gate yet.

104
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,002
So it's in its resting state.

105
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:37,010
Our sodium potassium
pumps are working.

106
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,008
Things are leaking back and
forth, but it's staying at

107
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,079
that minus 70 millivolts.

108
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,076
So that right there is
minus 70 millivolts.

109
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:51,011
Now as soon as this gate that's
way down some other

110
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,076
part of the cell opens, what's
going to happen?

111
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,091
And let's say that's the
only thing that's open.

112
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,037
So this, all of a sudden, is
going to become more positive.

113
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:01,018
So positive charges that's
already here-- so other

114
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:07,048
positive charges, whether
they're sodiums or potassiums,

115
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,025
they're going to want to run
away from that point because

116
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,048
this area hasn't had a flood
of positive things.

117
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,083
So it's less positive
than this over here.

118
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,067
So maybe we have some potassiums
and maybe we have

119
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,095
some sodiums. Everything is
going to want to move away

120
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:23,031
from the place where
this is opened.

121
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,058
The charge is going to
want to move away.

122
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,091
So as soon as this happens, as
soon as we open this gate,

123
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,045
we're going to have a
movement of positive

124
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,023
charge in this direction.

125
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:34,082
So all of a sudden-- this was
at minus 70 millivolts.

126
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,024
So more positive charge
is coming its way.

127
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:41,068


128
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:45,012
Almost immediately, it's going
to become less negative or

129
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,047
more positive.

130
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,058
The potential difference between
this and this is going

131
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,080
to become less.

132
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,098
So this is this point
over here.

133
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:57,089
Now if we took this point, if we
did the same thing-- if we

134
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,012
measured the voltage at this
point right here, maybe it was

135
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:06,014
at minus 70 millvolts, maybe a
fraction of a minute amount of

136
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:09,056
time later, the positive charge
starts affecting it so

137
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:13,001
it becomes more positive, but
the effect is diluted, right?

138
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,066
Because these positive charges,
they're going to

139
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,024
radiate in every direction.

140
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:17,041
So the effect is diluted.

141
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,012
So the effect on this thing
is going to be less.

142
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,086
It's going to become
less positive.

143
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:26,016
So an electrotonic potential--
what happens is at one point

144
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:30,038
in the cell, a gate opens,
charge starts flooding in, and

145
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,045
it starts affecting the
potential at other

146
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:33,062
parts of the cell.

147
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:40,097
But the positive of it is, it's
very fast. As soon as

148
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:41,081
this happens.

149
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:50,000
further down the cell, it starts
becoming more and more

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,081
positive, but the further you
go, the effect gets dissipated

151
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,056
with distance.

152
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:05,005
So if you care about speed,
you'd want this

153
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,024
electrotonic potential.

154
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,062
As soon as it happens, it'll
start affecting the rest of

155
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:11,075
the cell, but if you wanted
this potential change to

156
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:14,066
travel over large distances--
for example, let's say if we

157
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:18,002
got all the way to this point of
the neuron and we wanted to

158
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,020
measure it, it might not
have any impact.

159
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,041
Maybe a little bit later, but
it's not having any impact

160
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,092
because all of this gets diluted
by the time it gets--

161
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:26,095
it's increasing the charge
throughout the cell.

162
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:30,019
So it's a impact far away from
the initial place where the

163
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:30,075
gate opened.

164
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,024
It's going to be a lot less.

165
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:36,011
So it's really not good for
operating over distance.

166
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,004
Now let's try to figure
out what's going on

167
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,007
with an action potential.

168
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:43,031
And you might understand, this
might involve more action.

169
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,050
So let's start off with
the same situation.

170
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,050
We have a sodium gate that gets
opened by some stimulus.

171
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,073
What I'm going to do-- let me
draw two membranes here.

172
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,098
So this is the outside.

173
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:59,050


174
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,043
This is the inside.

175
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:05,068
And let me draw-- maybe we're
dealing with a-- and we'll go

176
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,026
in more detail.

177
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:11,087
Maybe this is an axon or
something, but let me-- let's

178
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:14,081
say we have another sodium
gate right here.

179
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:18,081


180
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,069
And then they're alternating,
essentially.

181
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,008
So they're alternating so then
I have another sodium gate.

182
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:38,051


183
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,098
I don't want to do
a bunch of these.

184
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:42,098
I think I just have to draw one
round of it for you to get

185
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,073
what's going on.

186
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,035
Let me draw another
potassium gate.

187
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:52,013


188
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:54,028
And let's say that they
all start closed.

189
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:56,024
So they're all in the
closed position.

190
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,075
Now let's say that this sodium
gate gets stimulated.

191
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,000
It gets opened.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,022


193
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,074
Let's say that guy right
there gets opened.

194
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,066
It gets stimulated by something
to get opened.

195
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:10,086
We'll talk about the things
that-- let's say in particular

196
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:20,015
this thing gets opened-- let's
say the stimulus-- it has to

197
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,021
be a certain voltage.

198
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:26,016
And let's say they become open
when we are at minus 55

199
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:27,041
millivolts.

200
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:33,039


201
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,090
So when we're just in our
resting state, the potential

202
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,026
difference between the inside of
the cell and the outside is

203
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:40,037
minus 70, so it's not
going to be open.

204
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,041
It's going to be closed, but if
for whatever reason, this

205
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,051
becomes positive enough to get
to minus 55 millivolts, all of

206
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:49,044
a sudden this thing
will be open.

207
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:52,073
Let's write a couple of other
rules that dictate what

208
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,062
happens to this gate.

209
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:57,087
Let's say it closes-- and these
are all rough numbers,

210
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:01,025
but the main idea is for you
to get the general idea.

211
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:10,090
Let's say it closes at--
I don't know-- plus 35

212
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,087
millivolts.

213
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:20,030
And let's say that our potassium
gate opens at plus

214
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,027
40 millvolts, just to give
an idea of things.

215
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:33,011
Let's say it closes at--
I don't know-- minus 80

216
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:34,036
millivolts.

217
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,021


218
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,000
So what's going to happen?

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,003
Lets say that, for whatever
reason, the voltage here has

220
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:41,062
now become minus 55.

221
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:44,083
Let me do a chart just
like I did down here.

222
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,085
So I want to have space
to draw my chart.

223
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:54,011


224
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,036
This is membrane voltage.

225
00:10:55,036 --> 00:11:00,037


226
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:03,008
And this is time down here.

227
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,017
And let's say we're measuring
it-- let's say this is the

228
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:08,078
membrane voltage at-- let's say
right by the sodium gate

229
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:09,014
right here.

230
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:10,035
So we're measuring this voltage

231
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,048
across this right here.

232
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:14,020
So if it's not stimulated any
way, we're just here,

233
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,005
flatlining at minus 70
millivolts-- and let's say

234
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,083
some stimulus, for
whatever reason,

235
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,062
makes this more positive.

236
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,095
Maybe it's some type of
electrotonic effect that's

237
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:26,042
making it more positive here.

238
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,044
Maybe some positive charges
are floating by.

239
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,086
So this becomes more positive.

240
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:33,053
So let's say this becomes more
positive and then the ATP

241
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:38,051
pumps-- the sodium potassium
pumps pump it out so it

242
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:41,077
doesn't get to the threshold of
minus 55, so then nothing

243
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:42,062
will happen, right?

244
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:43,063
It didn't get to
the threshold.

245
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,071
But then let's say there's
another electrotonic or maybe

246
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,095
a bunch of them and just there's
a lot of positive

247
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:54,048
charge here so we get to
the minus 55 millvolts.

248
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,096
Remember, when positive
charge comes by,

249
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,012
we become less negative.

250
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:59,011
The potential difference
becomes less negative.

251
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,071
We get to that minus
55 volts-- this

252
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,095
thing opens then, right?

253
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:05,020
This was closed before.

254
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,037
It was closed when we were
just at minus 70.

255
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,023
So let me write here.

256
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:20,032
So at this point, our
sodium gate opens.

257
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,003
Now, what's going to happen when
our sodium gate opens?

258
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,077
When that opens-- we've seen
this show before-- all the

259
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,050
positively charged sodium is
going to go down there, both

260
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,049
electric gradient and diffusion
gradient, and

261
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,034
there's going to flood
into the cell.

262
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,020
There's so much sodium out
there, it's so positive out

263
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,090
there, they just want
to come in.

264
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,035
So as soon as they hit that
threshold, even though this

265
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:44,090
might've only gotten us to minus
55 or maybe minus 50,

266
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,044
all of a sudden that gate opens
and we have all of this

267
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,016
positive charge flooding
into the cell.

268
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,048
So the potential difference
becomes

269
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:51,079
much, much more positive.

270
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,080


271
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,037
So they keep flooding in,
becomes much, much more

272
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:00,022
positive, but as it gets
more positive, it

273
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:15,034
closes at plus 35 millvolts.

274
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,087
So let's say that we're dealing
here-- let's say that

275
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:21,030
this up here is plus
35 millvolts.

276
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,072
So here it closes and at the
same time, that stuff I just

277
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:30,054
deleted-- I set at plus 40
millvolts-- or let's say at

278
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:32,032
plus 35, just for the
sake of argument.

279
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,084
Let's say at plus 45
millvolts, our

280
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:39,051
sodium gates open.

281
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,064
So what's happened here?

282
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:43,099
All of a sudden, we're at plus
35 or maybe plus 40 millivolts

283
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:47,042
so this is-- let's just say plus
40, I think you get the

284
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:51,084
idea either way so we'll say
plus 40-- either way.

285
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:56,010
So at plus 40, this guy's
going to close.

286
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,063
No more positive ions are coming
in, but now we are at

287
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:01,034
more positive inside, at least
locally at this point on the

288
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:03,007
membrane, than we are outside.

289
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,072
And so this gate will open.

290
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:08,022
So then our sodium
gate will open.

291
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:11,032
K-plus ion gate opens.

292
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,072
Now when that opens,
what happens?

293
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:15,079
We have all of these
sodium ions here.

294
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,037
We already saw from the sodium
potassium pump that the

295
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:22,050
potassium-- we have all of these
potassium ions here.

296
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,014
We saw from the sodium potassium
pump that it makes

297
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:27,027
the sodium concentration on
the outside higher and the

298
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:30,029
potassium concentration
on the inside higher.

299
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,033
And now that we've gotten to
this plus 40 millvolt range,

300
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:37,013
we're also now more positive
on the inside.

301
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,036
So this opens.

302
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,032
These guys want to escape
because there's

303
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,020
less potassium outside.

304
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,028
They want to go down their
concentration gradient.

305
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,094
It's also very positive
on the inside.

306
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,097
We're at plus 40 millvolts.

307
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,048
So they also want to escape.

308
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,050
So they start escaping
the cells.

309
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,035
So positive charges starts
exiting the cell from the

310
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:56,021
inside to the outside.

311
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,091
So we become less
positive again.

312
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,054
So let me write what
happens here.

313
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:07,052
So at this point, our sodium
gate closes and our potassium

314
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,013
gate opens.

315
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,091


316
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:14,025
And then the positive charge
starts flooding out of the

317
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:18,029
cell again and maybe it'll
overshoot because it's only

318
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,066
going to close maybe once we
get to minus 80 millvolts.

319
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:30,065
So maybe our potassium gate
closes at minus 80.

320
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:35,034
And then our sodium potassium
pump might get us back to our

321
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,054
minus 70 millvolts.

322
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:40,094
So, this is what's happening
just at this point in the

323
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:44,072
cell, just near that
first sodium gate.

324
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:47,003
But what's going to happen
in general, right?

325
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,067
As this became very positive--
we went to 40

326
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,034
millivolts over here.

327
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,049
We went to 40 millvolts in
this area of the cell.

328
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,097
Because of-- I guess you could
almost view it as a short term

329
00:15:56,097 --> 00:16:00,012
or very short distance
electrotonic potential, this

330
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,075
area is going to become
more positive, right?

331
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:03,090
This is going to become
more positive.

332
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,029
These positive charges
are going to go

333
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,097
where it's less positive.

334
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:09,003
So this is going to become
more positive.

335
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,097
This was at minus 70, but it's
going to become more positive.

336
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:18,020
It'll go to minus 65, minus 60,
minus 55-- and then bam.

337
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,077
This guy will get
triggered again.

338
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,005
Then this guy gets opened.

339
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,044
Then this guy gets opened.

340
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:25,042
Sodium floods in through here.

341
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,084
So if you wanted to plot this
guy's, the potential

342
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:33,024
difference of what's going on
across this, this all happened

343
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:36,062
as soon as-- maybe as soon as a
sodium started going in this

344
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:41,044
first dude, the second guy-- he
gets triggered here because

345
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:45,063
the second guy a little bit
later in time-- because of all

346
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,070
this flow a little bit to
the left of him, his

347
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,053
potential goes up.

348
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:53,023
He gets triggered, same exact
thing happens to him, right?

349
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,029
When the sodium flows in here,
becomes really positive around

350
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,062
here, that makes the cell
around here, the voltage

351
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,017
around here, the charge around
here a little bit more

352
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:04,093
positive, triggers this next
sodium gate to open and then

353
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:07,027
this whole same thing
happens, same cycle.

354
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,066
Then the potassium gates open to
make it negative again, but

355
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,096
by the time that's happened,
it's become positive over here

356
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,063
to trigger another
sodium gate.

357
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:18,006
So one after another, you have
these sodium gates opening and

358
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,083
closing, but it's transmitting
that information, it's

359
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,026
transmitting that potential
change.

360
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:25,013
So what's going on here?

361
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:27,099
So this is slower and it
actually involves energy.

362
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,020
So this was-- the electrotonic
was very fast. This is slow.

363
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,081
An action potential is slower.

364
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:35,034
I don't want to say it's slow.

365
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:38,040
It's slower because it has to
involve these opening and

366
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,042
closing of gates and it
also involves energy.

367
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,027
It also requires more energy.

368
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:47,088


369
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:50,044
And you're also going to have to
keep changing the potential

370
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:54,013
in your cell and you actively
have your sodium potassium

371
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,070
pumps being very active.

372
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,076
But it's good.

373
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,048
The positive is, it's good
at covering distance.

374
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:02,032


375
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,081
When you have something like
this-- we saw with the

376
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:06,016
electrotonic, as we get further
and further away from

377
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:09,011
where the stimulus happened,
the change in potential

378
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,032
becomes more and more
dissipated.

379
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,007
It actually exponentially
declines.

380
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,044
It becomes more and more
dissipated as we get further

381
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:17,002
and further away so it's not
good for long distance.

382
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:20,059
This thing can just continue
forever because every time it

383
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,017
stimulates the next gate, it's
like we're starting all over

384
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:26,094
again and so this gate-- it's
going to have a flood of ions

385
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:30,054
come in and those ions are going
to make it a little less

386
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:31,077
negative over here.

387
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,010
Then the next gate's
going to open.

388
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,075
We're going to have the cycle
over and over again.

389
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:38,021
So this is really good for
traveling long distances.

390
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:40,084
So now we have really the
foundation to understand

391
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:43,088
exactly what's happening in a
neuron and I'm going to go

392
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,032
over that in the next video to
show you how electrotonic

393
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:49,081
potentials and action potentials
can combine to have

394
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,097
a signal travel through
a neuron.

395
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,022

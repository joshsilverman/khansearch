1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,059


2
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:04,025
In talking about the adaptive
immune system, we've already

3
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:05,083
seen that there's a
couple of actors.

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:16,025


5
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:20,007
You have your humoral
response.

6
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:22,037
So this is responding to things
that are floating

7
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:24,058
around in the fluids of the
body and not necessarily

8
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:27,082
things that have infiltrated
your body cells and then you

9
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:31,024
have your cell mediated
response.

10
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:35,074


11
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:38,020
And then in the humoral
response-- and we're talking

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,067
about specific humoral
response-- this is where the B

13
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:45,021
cells, the B lymphocytes are
at their most active.

14
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:48,053
And essentially what they do
is, you got a B cell here.

15
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:52,089
It has a very specific antibody,
specific to just

16
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,064
this B cell, not B
cells in general.

17
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:59,000
If this happens to be the one
of the billions of B cells

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,054
that happens to have the
matching key-- or maybe I

19
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:05,092
should say the matching lock
for the key that is the

20
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:09,026
intruding pathogen--
that pathogen will

21
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,056
bind to that B cell.

22
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:14,042
Maybe it's a virus, maybe
it's a bacteria.

23
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:17,089
And then the B cell will get
activated and we'll talk about

24
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:19,045
in this video that
the activation

25
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,062
doesn't always happen.

26
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:23,073
In fact, it usually doesn't
happen just from this, but so

27
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:28,085
far we've said it gets
activated, it goes into memory

28
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:31,031
B cells, which are essentially
multiple versions of this

29
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:33,045
original B cell-- just saying,
hey, let's have multiple

30
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:36,064
versions of this-- because it
tends to recognize this virus.

31
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,015
So in the future if we get this
virus, those multiple

32
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,045
versions, those memory cells are
going to be there to have

33
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:43,023
this interaction.

34
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:45,053
This interaction's going to be
more likely to happen in the

35
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:47,020
future because I'm going
to have more of this

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,064
variety of B cell.

37
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:49,098
And then you have
effector cells.

38
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:53,031


39
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,073
And these are essentially-- so
both of these are B cells.

40
00:01:56,073 --> 00:02:00,023
So this guy, once he gets
activated, he proliferates,

41
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:02,043
keeps dividing and
cloning himself.

42
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:05,090
The memory cells just stick
around waiting to be activated

43
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,089
in the future.

44
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:10,056
And I'm only drawing one
of these membrane bound

45
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:13,053
antibodies, but there are
actually 10,000 on them.

46
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:15,000
I mean, I could draw
a bunch of these.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,030
I don't have to just draw one.

48
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,012
The memories just wade around
in the future, but there's

49
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:19,084
more of them now.

50
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:23,061
So in the future, if we get
this virus again, this

51
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,034
interaction's going to happen
faster and so they're going to

52
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:27,080
get activated faster.

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,030
And then the effector B
cells essentially turn

54
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,099
into antibody factories.

55
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,009
This antibody goes in and it
says, let me just produce--

56
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:39,087
I've been activated.

57
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,019
Let me produce many,
many more versions

58
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,046
of that exact antibody.

59
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:46,071
So they get spit out.

60
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,066
I drew that one little wrong.

61
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:53,003
So that exact antibody, that
can then be spit out to go

62
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:57,016
disable or tag antigens-- and
not just any antigen-- this

63
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:00,028
antigen right here.

64
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,055
And we also saw that the other
thing that the B cell does is

65
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:06,018
it becomes an antigen
presenting cell.

66
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:11,066
So what it does is, as soon as
it recognizes this, it's had

67
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,059
this interaction with an antigen
that just matches the

68
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:17,071
variable portion of its membrane
bound antibody.

69
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,087
It endocytosizes that.

70
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:22,034
It brings that into itself.

71
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:25,041
It's membrane facilitated so it
just kind of pulls it in,

72
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,077
chunks it up, and then presents
a piece of that

73
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:31,091
antibody on an MHC
II molecule.

74
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,024
We saw that in the last video.

75
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:36,021
So it cuts that up and presents
a piece of it right

76
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,052
there and that's why we call it
an antigen presenting cell.

77
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,031
Now in this video, we're going
to talk about why we even have

78
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,011
these MHC II molecules.

79
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,000
What are we presenting
these antigens to?

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,050
So we're going to start
talking about the cell

81
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,036
mediated-- and actually, even
more than the cell mediated,

82
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:51,076
we're going to talk
about T cells.

83
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:56,028


84
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,012
And I said in the first video,
they're called T cells because

85
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,043
they mature in the thymus.

86
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:07,011


87
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,093
And there are two types of
T cells and it's all very

88
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,081
confusing because you have B
cells and T cells, but then

89
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:13,056
there are two types
of T cells.

90
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:18,093
You have helper T cells-- and
most people just write T with

91
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:21,043
a lower-case or subscript
h there.

92
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:26,037
And then you have cytotoxic T
cells-- or T cells that kill

93
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:27,062
other cells.

94
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:32,076


95
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:36,056
Now just so that you have a big,
overarching impression of

96
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:39,007
what does what-- B cells.

97
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:43,063
When they are activated, they
generate antibodies.

98
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:46,041
At 30,000 feet, that's the
best summary of what an

99
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,062
activated B cell does.

100
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:49,069
It actually generate
antibodies.

101
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,018
Those antibodies attach to
viruses and bacteria and other

102
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,092
types of pathogens and disables
them-- either tags

103
00:04:55,092 --> 00:05:02,031
them so that macrophages can go
and eat them up or just by

104
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:06,004
throwing all of those antibodies
on to the surface

105
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,050
of the pathogen in question.

106
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,086
It might disable the pathogens
or essentially bundle them

107
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,085
altogether so that it'll be
easier for macrophages to pick

108
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:17,081
them up, but this is only
effective for things that are

109
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,039
floating around.

110
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,070
Free floating antibodies are
only effective for things that

111
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,016
are floating around.

112
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:27,048
Cytotoxic T cells, which I'll
cover in more detail in a

113
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:32,000
future video-- these actually
attack cells that have been

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,025
infiltrated.

115
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:42,086
So this is attack, kill,
infiltrated cells-- and when I

116
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:45,032
say infiltrated, it could be a
cell that a virus has gone

117
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:47,052
into or some bacteria
has penetrated it.

118
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:49,025
And when I say infiltrated, it
doesn't necessarily even mean

119
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,011
something from the outside.

120
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,001
It could even be a cancerous
cell that shows itself to be

121
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:57,032
abnormal in some way and so the
cytotoxic T cells will at

122
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:59,025
least attempt to kill them.

123
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,050
But what I want to focus on--
out of the three types of

124
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,062
lymphocytes-- remember,
everything we've been talking

125
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:09,057
about was leukocytes, white
blood cells, but lymphocytes

126
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:12,064
are a subset of that and these
three are lymphocytes.

127
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:14,087
And they're called that because
they began their

128
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:18,066
development in the
bone marrow.

129
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:24,025
So this guy and this guy
actually do stuff.

130
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,039
This guy generates antibodies
that attach to pathogens

131
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,054
floating around.

132
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,008
This guy directly attacks
cells that are

133
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,000
broken in some way.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,069
They've either been infiltrated,
they're abnormal,

135
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,073
they're cancerous--
who knows what.

136
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:39,073
And I'll do a whole video on
that, but that leads us to a

137
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:40,076
very obvious question.

138
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,042
What does this guy do?

139
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:47,064
What does the helper T cell
do if he doesn't directly

140
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:50,068
interface either with pathogens
or produce things

141
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,018
that interface with pathogens--
or if he himself

142
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:55,035
doesn't go and directly
kill cells?

143
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:58,051
And the answer is that the
helper T cell's kind of the

144
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,013
alarm of the immune system.

145
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,062
And on some level, it's almost
the most important.

146
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:08,023
So we talked already in the
last video about antigen

147
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:11,042
presenting cells-- that either
when a macrophage or a

148
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:15,029
dendritic cell takes things
in, it cuts them up and

149
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,075
presents it on its surface as
these MHC II proteins or in

150
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:24,023
complex with these MHC II
complexes or proteins.

151
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:27,006
And so do B cells.

152
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:28,093
B cells are more specific.

153
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, once something is
presented, now the helper T

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,099
cell can come into
the picture.

155
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:39,099
So this is a-- let me do a
dendritic cell-- and I'm doing

156
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,070
dendritic cells actually on
purpose because dendritic

157
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,033
cells are actually
the best cells at

158
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,081
activating helper T cells.

159
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:49,043
We're going to talk about in a
second what happens when a

160
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:51,054
helper T cell gets activated.

161
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,008
So let's say I have this
dendritic cell.

162
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,075
It's called dendritic so
it looks like it has

163
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,000
dendrites on it.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,037


165
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,036
So I have this dendritic
cell here.

166
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:06,004
It's a phagocyte.

167
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:10,018
Let's say it's already consumed
some type of bacteria

168
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:14,072
or virus and it's cut it up and
now it's presenting kind

169
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:19,027
of the body parts of that virus
on the MHC II complex.

170
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:23,064


171
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,082
It's kind of its way of saying,
hey, I found this

172
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:29,008
shady thing floating around
in the body's tissues.

173
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,017
Maybe someone ought
to raise an alarm.

174
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:35,010
Maybe this is part of some type
of bigger thing going on

175
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,066
and some type of alarm bell
has to be released.

176
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:40,041
And that's what the helper
T cell does.

177
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,008
So let's say this guy--
he's presented it.

178
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,009
He says, I found this thing.

179
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:43,061
I killed it.

180
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:44,099
Here's a part of it.

181
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,027
The helper T cell has a
T cell receptor on it.

182
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,048
Let's say this is the helper
T cell right here.

183
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:55,019


184
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,061
And it has a T cell receptor on
it and the T cell receptors

185
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:03,023
bond to-- and I'll be very
particular here.

186
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,071
So this is the T
cell receptor.

187
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:07,021


188
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:11,079
It's just like a protein, but
like the membrane bound

189
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,026
antibodies on B cells that every
B cell or almost every B

190
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:18,087
cell has a different version,
different variable chain,

191
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:24,024
that's also true of helper T
cells-- that just like the B

192
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:27,065
cells, this has some variation
in where it binds.

193
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:31,002
So this right here is going to
be variable from one helper T

194
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:31,080
cell to another.

195
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,059
For example, I might have
another helper T cell here.

196
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:41,037
That also has a T cell receptor,
but the variable

197
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:47,002
portion on that T cell receptor
is different than the

198
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,010
variable portion on this
T cell receptor.

199
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,037
So this helper T cell will not
bind to this dendritic cell or

200
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:58,012
the MHC II complex of
this dendritic cell.

201
00:09:58,012 --> 00:09:59,050
Only this one would.

202
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,060
And the mechanism of how you
get this variation is very

203
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,028
similar to the mechanism in how
you get the variation on

204
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,016
the antibodies and
the B cells.

205
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:12,011
During these helper T cells'
development, at some point the

206
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,094
genes that code for this part of
this receptor get shuffled

207
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:18,079
around and they get shuffled
around intentionally so that

208
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,009
each T cell has a certain
specificity to a combination

209
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:28,017
of an MHC II complex and a
certain polypeptide, a certain

210
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,052
part of a virus.

211
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:32,072
So only this guy's going to be
activated, not this guy.

212
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:35,048
So this is why we call it the
specific immune system.

213
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,066
Now we said, what does
that helper T

214
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:40,005
cell do at that point?

215
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:44,004
He said, hey, I happen to be the
one helper T cell that can

216
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:46,092
bond to this guy, this antigen
that's presented.

217
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:49,045
It becomes activated.

218
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,067
And I won't go into the details,
but in general,

219
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,029
dendritic cells are the best
ones at activating it,

220
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,005
especially a naive T cell.

221
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:02,077


222
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:05,059
In general, when we talk about
a naive B cell or a naive

223
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,037
helper T cell, these are cells
that are non-memory,

224
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:11,082
non-effector, that have never
been touched by-- they've

225
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:14,075
never been activated, in
the case of a B cell.

226
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:18,041
They've never been activated by
something binding to their

227
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:23,003
membrane bound antibody-- or
a naive helper T cell is a

228
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:26,074
non-effector, non-memory helper
T cell that's never had

229
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,017
anything bound to it.

230
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:33,069
So if this guy is naive and then
he finally has a reaction

231
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:37,047
with this antigen presenting
cell, he becomes non-naive.

232
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:41,052
He becomes activated and when
activated, two things happen.

233
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:44,087
Well, just like with B cells,
he proliferates many, many,

234
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:48,083
many copies of himself and some
subset of those copies

235
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,065
differentiate into
effector cells.

236
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:54,036


237
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,016
And effector just means
it does something.

238
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,013
It does something now instead
of saving the memory.

239
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:01,012


240
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:08,037
And then some subset of them
become memory helper T cells

241
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:12,002
after getting activated.

242
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:15,001
Now the memory T cells, just
like memory B cells-- now you

243
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,012
have more copies of this.

244
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:17,096
So in 10 years in the future,
if something like this

245
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:19,062
happens, this interaction's
going to be

246
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:20,076
more likely to happen.

247
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:25,012
These guys have the same T cell
receptor as their parent.

248
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:33,071


249
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:36,026
It's just that the memory T
cells-- or actually even the

250
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:38,027
memory B cells-- they
last longer.

251
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,023
They don't kill themselves.

252
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:42,037
They'll last for years so that
if 10 years later, something

253
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:44,010
like this starts presenting
itself, you're going to have

254
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,055
more of these guys around to
bump into this guy so that you

255
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:49,070
can raise the alarm bells.

256
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,090
This guy's also going to have
the same chain right there.

257
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,062
So you're saying, fine.

258
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:58,087
I have these memory cells.

259
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,060
They're going to stick around
so that this reaction can

260
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,038
happen in the future, but I
still haven't answered the

261
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,079
question, what does the
effector T cell do?

262
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,003
What the effector T cell does
is it raises the alarm.

263
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:16,040


264
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,045
So there's an effector T cell.

265
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,070
It has been activated.

266
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,042


267
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,075
Remember, this is
very particular.

268
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:27,025
Only this version of T cells,
but once it got activated, it

269
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,030
produced many copies of itself
because it says, hey, I'm

270
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,017
responding to a particular
type of pathogen.

271
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,033
So that this is a
helper T cell.

272
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:37,046
This is an effector.

273
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,069
And what these do is they
start releasing these

274
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,024
molecules called cytokines.

275
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,079
So they start releasing
cytokines.

276
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:50,032


277
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,062
There are many, many different
types of cytokines and I'm not

278
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:56,015
going to go into detail on all
that, but what cytokines do is

279
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,002
that they really raise
the alarm.

280
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:03,008
So if you have other activated
lymphatic cells or other

281
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,000
activated immunological cells--
when the cytokines

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,060
enter those cells-- remember,
cytokines

283
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,085
are really just proteins.

284
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:14,061
When the cytokines enter-- or
polypeptides-- when they enter

285
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,037
those cells, it makes
them get in gear.

286
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:21,087
It makes them multiply more
often or it makes them get

287
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:24,023
more active in their
immune response.

288
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,074
So what this does-- these
cytokines you can view as

289
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:34,042
chemical alarm bells chemical
or peptide alarm bells alarm

290
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:38,002
bells it it tells everyone
to get in gear.

291
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,030
So that's one role, and so you
can see this is actually a

292
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,004
very central role and it'll tell
both activated cytotoxic

293
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:47,075
T cells to get in gear, which
we haven't talked about yet.

294
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:50,055
And it'll also tell B cells
to keep proliferating.

295
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,094
So when an activated B cell gets
some of-- so this is an

296
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,088
activated B cell.

297
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,023
When it gets some of these
cytokines, that maybe come

298
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,079
from a local helper T cell,
it'll tell it, hey no, divide

299
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,041
more often.

300
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,026
Divide more often.

301
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,075
Only if you've been
activated already.

302
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:07,063
And we'll talk more about why
it has to be that case,

303
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:10,037
because you don't want all the
B cells to be activated.

304
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:13,022
And the other thing that the
effector T cell does-- in the

305
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:21,046
B cell discussion, I said, OK,
if I have a B cell, and it has

306
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,012
its membrane bound
antibody, has its

307
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,050
membrane bound antibody.

308
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,037
And remember, this is a
particular version, it has its

309
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,083
particular variable
chain right here.

310
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,064
And this guy binds
to a pathogen.

311
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:36,029
So this binds to a pathogen.

312
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,042
Maybe it's a virus
right there.

313
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:41,067
Up to now, I've been saying
that this guy's activated.

314
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:44,058
And he's going to-- well, when
he binds to the pathogen he'll

315
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:49,098
take this in and he'll take part
of the pathogen and cut

316
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:55,075
it up and place it on
an MHC II molecule.

317
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,040
And we said, then he'll
be activated.

318
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,023
He'll proliferate and he'll
differentiate into memory and

319
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:02,092
effector B cells-- but that's
not quite true.

320
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,035
This first stage happens.

321
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:05,060
This guy bonds.

322
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,077
This B cell happened to be
specific to this virus.

323
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,034
Cuts up the virus.

324
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:13,083
Puts parts of the virus on its
surface and presents parts of

325
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,073
the antigen.

326
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:19,062
But in most cases, this B cell
isn't yet activated.

327
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,038
You can kind of view it as in
its resting state, ready to be

328
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:24,058
activated, but it hasn't started
proliferating and

329
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:27,061
differentiating into effector
and memory molecules yet.

330
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:36,062
And in order for that to happen,
an activated helper T

331
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:40,058
cell that is also specific to
this very same virus-- so you

332
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:45,000
could imagine someplace else in
the cell-- this virus was

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,042
eaten by a dendritic cell.

334
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:52,013


335
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,094
So this exact same virus, this
exact same species of virus,

336
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:59,049
is eaten by that dendritic cell
and so the dendritic cell

337
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:05,090
eats it up, it cuts it up, and
then it presents it-- it's

338
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:10,033
antigen presenting so it
presents it just like that.

339
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,075
Then this will activate
a very specific T

340
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:14,056
cell, maybe that one.

341
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:20,098
So a very specific T cell will
come and bump into it.

342
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:23,000
Not just any T cell,
the one with the

343
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,028
right variable portion.

344
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:25,082
So think about what's
happening.

345
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:33,026
The variable portion for this
T cell, it connects to this

346
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:38,017
part of the virus plus the MHC
II, but it's really reacting

347
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,028
to the same virus.

348
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:40,078
It might be a different part.

349
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:43,075
This little part that was cut
off might be someplace inside

350
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:47,081
the virus while the epitope for
the B cell might be some

351
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:50,033
place on the outside of the
virus, but they're both

352
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:53,001
specific to the same virus.

353
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:56,099
Now once this guy gets activated
and he starts

354
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,076
producing memory and effector
cells-- or they're descended

355
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:02,022
from him, one of those effector
cells specific to

356
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:06,056
this virus are needed to
come bind to this guy.

357
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:09,034
So then this guy could then go
along and bump around and

358
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:11,041
eventually end up here.

359
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,009
And he is also specific
to this virus.

360
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,063
So this binding site right
here is the same as this

361
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,014
binding site.

362
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:21,094
This combination of antigen
plus MHC II.

363
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:29,043
And so when this guy binds--
and remember, this binding

364
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:31,085
site is the same as this and
it only binds to this

365
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:36,031
combination right here-- this
is what activates the B cell

366
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,088
in most cases.

367
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:41,035
This is T-dependent
activation, which

368
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,074
is usually the case.

369
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:45,030
Sometimes all you need is this
first thing, but in general

370
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,083
you need the first thing and
then you also need a T cell to

371
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,082
come and activate it, and only
then will the B cell get

372
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:55,053
activated and start
proliferating and dividing and

373
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:58,024
differentiating itself and
producing-- when its effector

374
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:00,024
cells will produce a
lot of antibodies.

375
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,040
And so there's a natural
question.

376
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,000
Why do biological systems--
or why do we

377
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,088
have this double system?

378
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:10,001
And at least my sense of it is,
it's a failsafe mechanism.

379
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:13,063
If every time a virus came and
attached this, this guy just

380
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:15,094
started going crazy and
producing antibodies against

381
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:20,095
this thing, there's some
chance that maybe after

382
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:26,044
development, this chain right
here or his genes for

383
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:30,032
generating these chains become
specific, not for foreign

384
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:35,018
pathogens, but maybe they
become specific for self

385
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:37,018
molecules, molecules
that are naturally

386
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,035
produced within the body.

387
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:40,099
It's just a random mutation, but
if he started going crazy

388
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:45,008
for that, his antibodies will
start attacking molecules that

389
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,028
are naturally in the body and
then that could really hurt.

390
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:51,024
That what causes autoimmune
diseases, where your own

391
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,020
immune cells start activating
yourself.

392
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,046
But if you have this double
handshake system where this

393
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:59,010
has to happen and this has to
happen, the likelihood of both

394
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,004
of these guys after they leave
their development stage

395
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:09,010
becoming specific to a self
protein or a self cell or a

396
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,000
self molecule is
very unlikely.

397
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,038
So it kind of inhibits this guy
from going wild, even if

398
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,018
he has some type
of a mutation.

399
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:19,034
Anyway, hopefully that explains
a little bit of what

400
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,051
helper T cells do.

401
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,010
We'll talk a lot
more about it.

402
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,097
I know it can be a little
bit confusing.

403
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:27,036
In the next video, we'll talk
about cytotoxic T cells.

404
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:32,083

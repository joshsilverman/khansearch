1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040


2
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,067
Let's talk a little bit about
the structure of the cell.

3
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:06,048
I've done a lot of videos where
we deal with things that

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,056
go on inside of them, but I
haven't done one where we just

5
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,086
talk about the entire
structure of them.

6
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:14,050
So a good place to start is--
let me just draw the membrane.

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,085
And the cellular membrane is a
good place to start because

8
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:20,078
this is what separates the cell
from the outside world,

9
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:24,001
and to a large degree, it kind
of defines the cell.

10
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,019
It defines it as this very,
very small compartment.

11
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,021
That's where the word,
"cell" came from.

12
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,087
So let me label that.

13
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:35,039
Cellular membrane.

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,057
And all cells have a
cellular membrane.

15
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:45,049
Now if we think about maybe the
most important thing that

16
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,059
defines a cell, you've probably
seen in the DNA

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,067
videos and we're going to talk
about translation and

18
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,029
transcription and all of that,
that what defines what a

19
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,043
living organism is,
is its DNA.

20
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:57,057
So all cells have DNA
inside of it.

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,027
And I won't go into the details
of how DNA defines

22
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,014
what an organism is.

23
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:03,057
I've done that in some detail
on the DNA videos.

24
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:05,001
But all cells have DNA.

25
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:09,015
This is more of an anatomy of a
cell video than necessarily

26
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:11,020
the function, but we'll go into
the function because we

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,078
need to know what these
different parts do.

28
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:16,060
So this is, right here,
this is the DNA.

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,039
And it's in its chromatin
form here.

30
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,018
There's also little
proteins here.

31
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:23,017
Not in all organisms, but
we're going to stick to

32
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,000
eukaryotes, and I'll talk
a little bit about the

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,063
difference between eukaryotes
and prokaryotes in a second.

34
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:29,093
But we have DNA.

35
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:33,039
As I've drawn this cell right
now, this is pretty much any

36
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,081
cell, and any animal or plant
or whatever kingdom

37
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,084
could look like this.

38
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,029
I haven't drawn a lot
of the details.

39
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:43,026
I've just drawn the DNA and
the cellular membrane.

40
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:47,045
Now here's kind of the first
major division in the living

41
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:52,043
world, or at least from our
point of view, or it seemed

42
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,056
obvious, is that some
cells have a

43
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:58,032
membrane around the DNA.

44
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:01,096
So they'll have a membrane
around the DNA that separates

45
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:05,009
the DNA and the chromatin and
everything that makes up the

46
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,009
stuff within the DNA, separates
that from the rest

47
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,012
of the cell, and this
is called a nucleus.

48
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:14,091
This is called a nucleus.

49
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:17,066
And I said that's a major
division because when some

50
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,077
people looked at some cells
and they saw a nucleus and

51
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,078
other cells and they didn't see
a nucleus, they said, hey,

52
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:25,021
this is a good way to classify
organisms. So they called the

53
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,047
things that had nucleuses,
eukaryotes.

54
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:30,046


55
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:32,015
These have a nucleus.

56
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:36,094
So as I've drawn this cell right
here, it is a eukaryote.

57
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:40,034
Now, if you do not have a
nucleus, you are dealing with

58
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,059
a prokaryote.

59
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:44,018


60
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:48,043
No nucleus.

61
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:52,031
And examples of prokaryotes,
the two big groups of them,

62
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:57,011
are bacteria and Archaea.

63
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,019
Now, Archaea are really
interesting.

64
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,090
We know very little
about them.

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,018
They were originally thought to
be types of bacteria, but

66
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,077
now people are realizing that
they're this whole completely

67
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:10,087
other group, and we've actually
observed a very small

68
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:13,005
subset of them, so it's a
very fascinating group.

69
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,003
And it actually turns out that,
evolutionarily speaking,

70
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,030
you shouldn't make this division
first. It actually

71
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,080
makes more sense to divide
things into eukaryotes, I'll

72
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,009
just write that Euk, bacteria
and Archaea.

73
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,022
You don't want to do this
division first. There are

74
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:31,037
actually three separate
groups that you want

75
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:33,078
to start off with.

76
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,084
We'll talk more about this
in future videos.

77
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,028
But if you want to say
who has a nucleus?

78
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:40,011
Well, eukaryotes have a
nucleus by definition.

79
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,066
Who does not have a nucleus?

80
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:46,011
Well, the bacteria and the
Archaea do not have nuclei,

81
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:46,074
just like that.

82
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:49,078
But I'm going to focus on
eukaryotes because they tend

83
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,050
to be a little bit
more complex.

84
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,006
They tend to be larger.

85
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,071
And most of what we talk about,
at least in the videos

86
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:57,081
so far, are dealing
with eukaryotes.

87
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:02,084
Eukaryotes include plants,
animals-- we're animals, at

88
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:08,068
least I am-- animals and fungi,
and there are other

89
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,002
groups within eukaryotes, but
these are the ones that we

90
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:14,028
normally deal with in
our everyday world.

91
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:16,082
But let's go back to looking
at the anatomy of the cell.

92
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:18,000
So we have our DNA.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,083
We know that it gets transcribed
into mRNA, That

94
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:29,054
mRNA leaves the nucleus, and
it gets translated into

95
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:32,038
proteins at the ribosomes.

96
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,052
So the ribosomes are these
little complexes that could be

97
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,077
floating all over the cell, and
we'll see in a second that

98
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,043
they can also be attached
to these other membrane

99
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,027
structures.

100
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,052
So this is a ribosome.

101
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:47,056


102
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:51,058
And if all this talk of DNA
transcription into mRNA and

103
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:55,000
mRNA leaving the nucleus and
traveling to the ribosome to

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,070
be translated into proteins
makes no sense to you, there

105
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,072
are several videos where I
go into that in detail.

106
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,066
But what I want to do is just
focus on all of the different

107
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,081
parts to kind of give a
big picture of things.

108
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:11,058
So ribosomes are where mRNA that
gets transcribed inside

109
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:18,075
the nucleus from DNA, where it
gets translated into proteins.

110
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:21,057
So you can kind of view them as
the place where information

111
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:24,072
actually turns into proteins,
which then can be used

112
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:27,050
anywhere else in the cell.

113
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,016
And these ribosomes, they're
made up of proteins, and

114
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:33,030
actually they're made up RNA.

115
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,000
And so one question is, well,
where are the pieces of the

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,007
ribosomes made?

117
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,018
Well, some are made by proteins,
which might be made

118
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:40,060
in other ribosomes.

119
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,036
But some of it, the mRNA,
ribosomes, you can kind of

120
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:46,076
view them as this big
mess, if you were to

121
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,098
look at it in detail.

122
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,089
There's some protein there.

123
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,072
And I'm not drawing it that
realistically, but then you

124
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:55,012
have some mRNA tied in with
the protein, and the mRNA

125
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:58,049
isn't used for actual
information purposes like it

126
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:01,006
normally is when it goes from
DNA to the ribosome.

127
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:05,076
Within the ribosome itself,
ribosomal RNA is actually used

128
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,088
as part of the structure.

129
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:10,048
It actually helps the ribosome
function as a ribosome.

130
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:12,042
So it's actually part
of the ribosome.

131
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:20,006
And all of that gets built in
a part of the nucleus called

132
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,095
the nucleolus or the nucleole.

133
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:26,006
Let me write that down.

134
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,097
So this right here, this is
interesting right here.

135
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:34,068
This is the nucleolus
or the nucleole.

136
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,086
And it isn't a separate
organelle, and it's not

137
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:39,055
separated by a membrane, but it
shows up in a microscope.

138
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:41,012
So when people first saw it,
they said, hey, there's like a

139
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:41,098
bundle there.

140
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:45,020
That must be like the core of
the nucleus or something.

141
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,092
But it turns out what it is,
it's the densely packed--

142
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:50,018
you've got DNA and RNA, and
that's actually where the

143
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:54,024
ribosomal RNA, the stuff that
makes up the ribosomes, is

144
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,001
actually produced.

145
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,081
But it's so dense that it shows
up on a microscope, and

146
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:00,007
that's why people decided to
name it something different.

147
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,050
But it is not membrane bound.

148
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,095
It's not an organelle
within an organelle.

149
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:08,008
It's just densely packed
proteins and ribosomal RNA,

150
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:11,055
and it's where ribosomal
RNA gets produced.

151
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,062
So anyway, we're at
the ribosome.

152
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,039
That's where proteins
get produced.

153
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,002
But if the ribosomes are just
floating around, if they're

154
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:21,033
free ribosomes, then those
proteins will just-- once

155
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,043
they're produced at the
ribosome, they'll just float

156
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,058
around here in the fluid
inside the cell

157
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,083
that we call cytosol.

158
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,018


159
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:32,082
But what if we wanted to produce
proteins that are

160
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:36,094
supposed to end up, maybe in the
membrane of the cell, or

161
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:39,085
maybe outside of the
cell itself?

162
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,097
Cells produce things that are
used by other cells, that are

163
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:43,044
used by the rest of the body.

164
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:47,043
And here we have to go to
proteins that are attached to

165
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:48,022
this membrane.

166
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,057
You can kind of view it
as a bunch of tunnels.

167
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:52,087
Let me see how well
I can draw that.

168
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:55,012
I'm going to draw
it very roughly.

169
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,067
You have this thing called the
endoplasmic reticulum.

170
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,092
Endoplasmic reticulum.

171
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,099


172
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:06,020
You can just view it as a bunch
of tunnels like that.

173
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,045
Endoplasmic reticulum.

174
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,047


175
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:13,013
And they eventually lead to
something called Golgi bodies,

176
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,073
named after Mr. Golgi himself.

177
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:18,011
So I'll do the endoplasmic
reticulum in yellow and I'll

178
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:23,051
do the Golgi bodies in green
maybe, just like that.

179
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,033
I'll tell you in a second
what they are.

180
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,017
So what's going on?

181
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:30,019
This is kind of a big kind of
stack, or you can kind of view

182
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,025
it as a bunch of folded
membranes together.

183
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:36,003
And some ribosomes are actually
attached to this

184
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,084
part, which I call the
endoplasmic reticulum.

185
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,087
So we have ribosomes attached.

186
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,039
Some of them are free, some
of them are attached.

187
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,005
And let me write
my labels down.

188
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:51,053
So this right here, and we use
the space over here, this big

189
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:55,042
flap of convoluted
membrane, that's

190
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,067
the endoplasmic reticulum.

191
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:02,020


192
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,001
It's fun to say.

193
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,065
Endoplasmic reticulum.

194
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:08,050
Maybe a good name for a band.

195
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,077
Endoplasmic reticulum, and the
parts that have ribosomes

196
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:14,086
attached to it are called the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

197
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,013
Maybe even a better
name for a band.

198
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:21,075
So right here, where I have
attached ribosomes, so these

199
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:24,076
ribosomes are attached right
here, this is the rough

200
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:28,063
endoplasmic reticulum, or
maybe the rough ER.

201
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:35,040
The rough ER, ER standing for
endoplasmic reticulum.

202
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,021
And then where we don't have any
ribosomes attached, that's

203
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:41,052
the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum.

204
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:48,007
So right here, that is this
smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

205
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,034
And I'm going to tell you in a
second what this is, but we

206
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,087
can keep following
the membranes.

207
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,049
Eventually we get the
Golgi bodies.

208
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:57,064


209
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,050
And what happens is,
I gave you a hint.

210
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,042
In our free ribosomes, mRNA gets
there, gets translated

211
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,061
into proteins, and the proteins
then just float

212
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,036
around in the cytosol.

213
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:08,092
But what if we want proteins
that should end up in

214
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:11,019
membranes or that end up
outside of the cell?

215
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,000
And that's where the endoplasmic
reticulum and the

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,088
Golgi bodies come into play.

217
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:20,067
Because now what we can do is,
we have mRNA coming outside of

218
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:24,055
the nucleus, and it can attach
to the ribosomes or it can be

219
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:27,069
translated by the ribosomes
in the rough ER.

220
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:30,019
And what happens here is your
mRNA comes here and it's

221
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,024
getting-- and I drew that
arrow very small-- it's

222
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,072
getting translated on the
outside of the endoplasmic

223
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:38,094
reticulum, but as the protein
gets produced, it's getting

224
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:42,065
pushed into the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

225
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:44,095
And when I say the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum, I'm

226
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,059
talking about this area.

227
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,047
I'm coloring it in.

228
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:51,002
This is the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

229
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:53,007
And so the proteins will
get pushed into

230
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:54,044
the endoplasmic reticulum.

231
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:57,039
The ones that are to be used
outside of the cytosol,

232
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,039
outside of the cell or maybe
in the cell's membrane.

233
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,035
So proteins will end up here.

234
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,012
That's why those ribosomes are
on the membrane, because they

235
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:06,031
can translate things that are
outside of the endoplasmic

236
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:11,079
reticulum, but as the proteins
get produced, the amino acid

237
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,042
chain ends up inside of it.

238
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:16,062
Let me make a blow-up
of that because I

239
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,092
think that'll be useful.

240
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:23,042
So let me draw-- let's say this
is the membrane of the

241
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:26,045
endoplasmic reticulum
and then you have

242
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:29,008
ribosomes attached to it.

243
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:32,089
Let's say that's a ribosome on
the endoplasmic reticulum.

244
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,086
And is this is going to be the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

245
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:39,078
And what you can have is mRNA
coming into one side of it.

246
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,082


247
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:46,086
mRNA can kind of come
in through here.

248
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:48,004
Maybe it's going in
that direction.

249
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,042
It's getting translated
into the proteins.

250
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,080
But then the protein, as the
amino acid chain is built up,

251
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,071
will pop out on this end
of the membrane.

252
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:00,029
Remember, this is our membrane
of our endoplasmic reticulum.

253
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,007
So even though the mRNA is on
the outside, because the

254
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,071
ribosome is attached to
it, the protein can

255
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,078
show up on the inside.

256
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,050
So once the protein is built,
maybe then it folds all up,

257
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,089
you know, a protein is just a
folded chain of amino acids,

258
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,037
it can travel through the
endoplasmic reticulum.

259
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,091
And it travels through it.

260
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:21,013
It travels through the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum all the

261
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,059
way until it gets to
the Golgi bodies.

262
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,087
And all sorts of other
things happen.

263
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:26,022
I'm oversimplifying things, but
I just want to give you a

264
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:28,058
sense of what everything
in the cell does.

265
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:31,038
And once the protein travels to
the Golgi bodies and they

266
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:35,023
get ready for traveling outside
of the cell, or maybe

267
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:38,071
traveling to the cell's
membrane, they'll actually bud

268
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:39,076
out of the Golgi bodies.

269
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:42,052
So let's say this same protein,
when it gets to the

270
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,022
Golgi bodies-- remember it's
inside of the Golgi body, so

271
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,079
let me draw the membrane of the
Golgi body right there.

272
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,051
The protein might
end up there.

273
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,083
It's just a big chain
of amino acids.

274
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,087
And then it will bud out.

275
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,077
So let's say it looks like that,
and then maybe the next

276
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:59,062
step it will look
something like.

277
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:00,087
It will look like that.

278
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:07,017


279
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,030
And the very next step, you
could imagine, will look

280
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,087
something like this, where
it's actually completely

281
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,041
budded out.

282
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,085
It's popped out a little
of the membrane of the

283
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,007
Golgi body with it.

284
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,000
So now the protein
is surrounded by

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,075
its own little membrane.

286
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:24,059
So let's think about
what happened.

287
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,025
We had DNA transcribed
into mRNA.

288
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:30,098
mRNA goes to a ribosome
that's attached to

289
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:32,074
the endoplasmic reticulum.

290
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:35,074
It is translated into a protein
that travels through

291
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,032
the endoplasmic reticulum.

292
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,014
First, the rough, where
all the ribosomes

293
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:40,040
are, then this smooth.

294
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,074
The smooth has other
functions.

295
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:48,051
It also helps produce hormones
and other fatty compounds, but

296
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,085
I won't go into detail there.

297
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:50,094
But it just travels.

298
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:53,007
It connects to the
Golgi bodies.

299
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:56,048
Then the Golgi bodies, the
proteins can bud off and take

300
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,034
a little bit of the
membrane with it.

301
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:01,089
And this idea of something being
surrounded by a membrane

302
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,039
and just traveling in the cell,
so maybe the protein now

303
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,010
looks like this.

304
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,092
I'm enlarging it.

305
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:09,037
Maybe the protein is there and
then it took a little bit of

306
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:12,020
the Golgi body membrane
with it.

307
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,077
This is called a vesicle.

308
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:17,075
And this right here, let's add
another one right here.

309
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:19,098
I'm just doing that
to label it.

310
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:23,015
That's called a vesicle.

311
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,011
And a vesicle is really just
a very general term for

312
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:30,027
anything, little small things,
mostly proteins, in the cell

313
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:32,042
that are just floating around,
that are surrounded by their

314
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,032
own little mini-membranes.

315
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:36,077
And the reason why this
mini-membrane is useful is now

316
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:39,042
this protein can now
float to the outer

317
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,042
membrane of the cell.

318
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,012
It can also float to other
parts of the cell.

319
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:43,077
I'm doing a simplification.

320
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:47,000
And then it can merge either
with the membrane of the cell,

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,095
or it can use this membrane,
this little vesicle membrane

322
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:54,024
it has, to facilitate it getting
out of the cell.

323
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,080
You can imagine that it
eventually, you know this

324
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,042
thing-- let's say this is the
outer membrane of the cell.

325
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,047
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification.

326
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:04,023
I'm not even drawing
the bilipid layer.

327
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:07,058
But just to have a visual
impression of what it might

328
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:11,087
look like, that's the vesicle
there, the little protein

329
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,067
inside of it, and it gets
closer and closer to the

330
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:18,052
membrane, and then it can
merge with the membrane

331
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,029
because it's made up
of the same stuff.

332
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,005
It merges with the membrane,
your protein inside.

333
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,025
I switched colors arbitrarily.

334
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,013
But now, all of a sudden, once
it merges with the membrane,

335
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:31,091
then the protein can exit the
actual cell, or maybe it can

336
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:35,021
actually embed itself within
this membrane, within the

337
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:39,020
outer cellular membrane, which
I drew very thin, but it has

338
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,096
two layers to it.

339
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:40,097
And we'll talk more
about that.

340
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:44,012
And I could probably make
a whole video on it.

341
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:47,097
So those are-- we've already
made pretty good progress on

342
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,039
showing the anatomy
of the cell.

343
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,036
There are a few other things
we can throw in there.

344
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:58,086
There are things called
lysosomes, which exist in

345
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:03,084
animal cells that contain
enzymes in them that help

346
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,015
dissolve other things.

347
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:08,072


348
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:12,004
So if a lysosome attaches to
something else and is able to

349
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,095
spew its enzymes into it,
it usually kills it.

350
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:16,013
It usually digests it.

351
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,010
So that's what a
lysosome does.

352
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,030
In plants, you have things
called lytic vacuoles, and

353
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,060
those are really the same thing
as a lysosome in terms

354
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,027
of their function in that
they're really big vesicles.

355
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,059
In fact, in general, a vacuole
is just a big vesicle.

356
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:36,062
It's just a general term for a
big membrane-bound organelle.

357
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,042
Vacuole.

358
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,027
And once again, what's
an organelle?

359
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:42,000
Let me write down that word.

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,073
Organelle.

361
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:48,077
It's just a membrane-bound
subunit of a cell.

362
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:51,042
Just like my liver is a subunit
of Sal and it's an

363
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:55,048
organ, an organelle is
a subunit of a cell.

364
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:59,001
So a vacuole is just a general
term for a membrane-bound

365
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:02,028
organelle that stores stuff
inside of our cells.

366
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:05,007


367
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:08,040
So a lytic vacuole would be a
vacuole in a plant cell that

368
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,044
stores a bunch of enzymes, and
if it were attached to

369
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:12,061
something else it would dissolve
it if it were able to

370
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:16,006
spew its enzymes into
the other thing.

371
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,004
Now, there's several organelles
that we've talked

372
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,023
about within the context
of respiration and

373
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:24,061
photosynthesis, and I go into
detail in those videos.

374
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:28,039
But we have things called
mitochondria.

375
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,006
Mitochondrion cells.

376
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:33,060
And they have inner and outer
membranes, and this is where

377
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,047
we produce our energy, where
sugars are turned into ATP.

378
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,026
I've done detailed
videos on this.

379
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,034
These actually contain their own
DNA, and they can actually

380
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:50,006
reproduce on their own, which
makes people believe that they

381
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:54,077
exist-- that their ancestors
once existed as independent

382
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:59,091
prokaryotic organisms, that at
some point they just kind of

383
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:03,071
stumbled upon the notion of,
hey, why don't I live inside

384
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:06,065
of other organisms and kind
of live in symbiosis?

385
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:11,001
So mitochondria, these are
organelles that at one time

386
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,014
their ancestors might have been
independent prokaryotes.

387
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:17,039


388
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,040
Mitochondria.

389
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,080
That's where cellular
respiration takes part, and we

390
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,075
go into detail on that.

391
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,064
And then on the plant cells,
this is only in-- well,

392
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,082
definitely not in animal cells--
you have chloroplasts,

393
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,090
which are a subset of things
called plastids, but

394
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,099
chloroplasts are the
most famous.

395
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:37,013
Maybe I should do that in
especially green, green.

396
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,031
So we have chloroplasts.

397
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:39,098
And we know they have little
thylakoids in there.

398
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,075
This is where photosynthesis
takes place.

399
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,026
You have your grana
and all of that.

400
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,083
And I do go into detail in the
photosynthesis videos, but

401
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,027
it's good to know.

402
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,068
These are other organelles.

403
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:51,095
And just like mitochondria, they
have their own DNA and

404
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,044
their own ribosomes.

405
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:56,077
And so the belief is that they
were once independent

406
00:18:56,077 --> 00:19:01,021
prokaryotes that learned to live
in symbiosis inside of

407
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,008
larger eukaryotic cells.

408
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:06,035
So we're almost done, really,
with the structure cells.

409
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,061
There's other things we
can throw on here.

410
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:12,079
If we're dealing with plant
cells or non-animal cells,

411
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,007
we'll have something called a
cell wall, which will give

412
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:17,038
some strength to the
outer membrane.

413
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,008
You can kind of view
it that way, or it

414
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,068
gives it some rigidity.

415
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:23,048
So you have things called cell
walls, although they're not

416
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:25,043
necessarily completely rigid.

417
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,046
You can almost view them as
balloons that provide just a

418
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,032
little bit more rigidity.

419
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,052
Things like wood actually have
double cell walls for really

420
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:33,040
hard-core rigidity.

421
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,016
So this is a cell wall.

422
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:39,017
This is in non-animals.

423
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:43,080
And in plants it's made out of
cellulose, not cellulite.

424
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,071
That used to confuse me.

425
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:47,083
So this gives extra rigidity
or form to

426
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,050
the cellular membrane.

427
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,071
And then to actually give the
cell its actual structure, you

428
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,045
have these things called
microfilaments, or sometimes

429
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,089
actin filaments, and these are
these little pipes that go

430
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,017
throughout the cell.

431
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:03,080
These actually help give the
cell its actual structure in

432
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,088
three dimensions, and actually,
they can participate

433
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:08,015
in things moving around within
the cell or even the cell

434
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,091
moving around itself.

435
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:11,077
And just to be complete and
make sure we're covering

436
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:15,061
everything, if you watch the
mitosis and meiosis videos,

437
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:18,079
you have these things
called centrioles.

438
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,094
I go into detail there.

439
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:24,066
Centrioles that are right
outside of the nucleus.

440
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:28,015
Two centrioles that are at right
angles to each other

441
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:32,007
make up a centrosome, and they
kind of coordinate the

442
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:36,086
microtubules when we start
splitting the cells in mitosis

443
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,075
and meiosis.

444
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,071
I won't go into detail there.

445
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,049
I've done many videos
on that as well.

446
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,093
But so far, this is pretty much
everything you need to

447
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:46,085
know-- or at least a first
overview-- of the

448
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,006
structure of the cell.

449
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,096
And in one video, we finally
got it all in one place.

450
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:54,005
This is pretty much-- I haven't
delved into detail on

451
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:57,017
everything-- on all of the
major pieces of the cell.

452
00:20:57,017 --> 00:21:00,081
So hopefully, you have a better
big-picture view of how

453
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:03,055
things are organized
inside of it.

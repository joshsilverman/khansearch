1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,013
After being done with glycolysis and the Kreb's Cycle,

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:14,026
we're left with 10 NADHs and 2 FADH2s

3
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:17,073
and I told you that these are going to be used in the Electron Transport Chain

4
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:20,026
and they're all sitting in the matrix of our mitochondria

5
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:21,092
and I said that they're going to be used in the

6
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:27,000
Electron Transport Chain in order to actually generate ATP.

7
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:38,029
So that's what I'm going to focus on in this video--the Electron Transport Chain.

8
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:42,008
And just so you know, a lot of this stuff is known,

9
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,075
but some of the details are actually current areas of research.

10
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:48,000
People have models and they're trying to substantiate

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,006
the models, but things are happening at such a small

12
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:52,006
scale here, that people can just look at the evidence, some

13
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:55,014
of it of which is indirect, and say this is probably

14
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,000
what's happening. Most of this is very well established,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,073
but some of the exact mechanisms--for example--how exactly some of the proteins work--

16
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:08,006
aren't completely understood. So I think it's very important

17
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,053
for you to understand that this is kind of at the cutting edge.

18
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,013
You're already there.

19
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:16,006
So the basic idea here is that the NADHs--and that's where

20
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,093
I'll focus--FADH2 is kind of the same idea, although

21
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:22,026
it's electrons are at a slightly lower energy state, so they

22
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:26,059
won't produce quite as many ATPs. Each NADH--maybe I'll write it here--

23
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:34,020
each NADH is going to be, as you'll see, indirectly responsible

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,073
for the production of three ATPs, and each

25
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:43,059
FADH2, in a very efficient cell, in both of these cases,

26
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:49,046
will be indirectly responsible for the production of 2 ATPs.

27
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:52,020
And the reason why this guy produces fewer ATPs

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,006
is because the electrons that he has going into the Electron

29
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:59,020
Transport Chain are at a slightly lower energy level

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,033
than the ones from NADH.

31
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:05,053
So in general, I just said indirectly, how does this whole business work?

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,044


2
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:03,056
The whole process of natural
selection is to some degree

3
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:06,069
dependent on the idea of
variation, that within any

4
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:11,044
population of a species, you
have some genetic variation.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:15,063
So, for example, let's say I
have a bunch of-- well, this

6
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:19,050
is a circle species, and one guy
is that color, and then I

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,096
got a bunch more, maybe some
are that color-- oh, that's

8
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:26,007
the same color-- that one, and
that one, and that one.

9
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,062
And for whatever reason,
sometimes there are no

10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:32,003
environmental factors that will
predispose one of these

11
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,079
guys to be able to survive and
reproduce over the other, but

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,053
every now and then, there might
be some environmental

13
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:40,061
factor, and it makes maybe, all
of a sudden, this guy more

14
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,009
fit to reproduce.

15
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,017
And so for whatever reason, this
guy is able to reproduce

16
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:49,082
more frequently and these
guys less frequently.

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:53,014
And some of them get killed,
or whatever, or eaten by

18
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:56,046
birds, or whatever, or they're
just not able to reproduce for

19
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:59,007
whatever reason, and then maybe
these guys are something

20
00:00:59,007 --> 00:00:59,085
in between.

21
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:03,096
So over time, the frequency of
the different traits you see

22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,040
in this population
will change.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,070
And if they are drastic enough,
maybe these guys start

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,090
becoming dominant and start not
liking these guys, because

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,032
they're so different
or whatever else.

26
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:14,010
We could see a lot of
different reasons.

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,045
This could eventually turn
into a different species.

28
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:21,076
Now, the obvious question is
what leads to this variation?

29
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:27,051
In a population what leads to
this-- in fact, even in our

30
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:30,070
population, what leads to one
person having dirty blonde

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,048
hair, one person having brown
hair, one person having black

32
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:38,062
hair, and we have the spectrum
of skin complexions and

33
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:40,059
heights is pretty
much infinite.

34
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,090
What causes that?

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,093
And then one thing that I kind
of point to, we talked about

36
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:47,050
this a little bit in
the DNA video, is

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,043
this notion of mutations.

38
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:52,031
DNA, we learned, is just a
sequence of these bases.

39
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:56,043
So adenine, guanine, let's say
I've got some thymine going.

40
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:58,098
I have some more adenine,
some cytosine.

41
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:01,078
And that these code, if you have
enough of these in a row,

42
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,003
maybe you have a few hundred
or a few thousand of these,

43
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,071
these code for proteins or
they code for things that

44
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:10,002
control other proteins,
but maybe you have a

45
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,077
change in one of them.

46
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:14,033
Maybe this cytosine for whatever
reason becomes a

47
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,027
guanine randomly, or maybe these
got deleted, and that

48
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:19,081
would change the DNA.

49
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:23,015
But you could imagine, if I
went to someone's computer

50
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:26,021
code and just randomly started
changing letters and randomly

51
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,047
started inserting letters
without really knowing what

52
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:31,078
I'm doing, most of the time,
I'm going to break the

53
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:33,006
computer program.

54
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,080
Most of the time, the great
majority of the time, this is

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,005
going to go nowhere.

56
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,015


57
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:41,038
It'll either do nothing, for
example, if I go into

58
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,024
someone's computer program and
if I just add a couple of

59
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:45,018
spaces or something, that might
not change the computer

60
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:47,019
program, but if I start getting
rid of semicolons and

61
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,061
start changing numbers and all
that, it'll probably make the

62
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:50,084
computer program break.

63
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:53,005
So it'll either do nothing or
it'll actually kill the

64
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,059
organisms most of the time.

65
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:59,072
Mutations: sometimes, they might
make the actual cell

66
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:03,006
kind of run amok, and we'll do a
whole maybe series of videos

67
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:06,091
on cancer, and that itself
obviously would hurt the

68
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:09,084
organism as well as a whole,
although if it occurs after

69
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,050
the organism has reproduced, it
might not be something that

70
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,075
selects against the organism
and it also

71
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,093
wouldn't be passed on.

72
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,078
But anyway, I won't go
detailed into that.

73
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:21,046
But the whole point is that
mutations don't seem to be a

74
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,046
satisfying source
of variation.

75
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:26,034
They could be a source or kind
of contribute on the margin,

76
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:29,090
but there must be something more
profound than mutations

77
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,096
that's creating the diversity
even within, or maybe I should

78
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:36,028
call it the variation, even
within a population.

79
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,080
And the answer here is
really it's kind of

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,071
right in front of us.

81
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:43,030
It really addresses kind of one
of the most fundamental

82
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,025
things about biology, and it's
so fundamental that a lot of

83
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,078
people never even question
why it is the way it is.

84
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,090
And that is sexual
reproduction.

85
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:59,046


86
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:02,066
And when I mean sexual
reproduction, it's this notion

87
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:07,087
that you have, and pretty much
if you look at all organisms

88
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:10,068
that have nucleuses-- and we
call those eukaroytes.

89
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,078
Maybe I'll do a whole video on
eukaryotes versus prokaryotes,

90
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:18,005
but it's the notion that if you
look universally all the

91
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:20,018
way from plants-- not
universally, but if you look

92
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:23,063
at cells that have nucleuses,
they almost universally have

93
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:29,063
this phenomenon that you have
males and you have females.

94
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:33,050
In some organisms, an organism
can be both a male and a

95
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,092
female, but the common idea
here is that all organisms

96
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,052
kind of produce versions of
their genetic material that

97
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:44,095
mix with other organisms'
version of

98
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,013
their genetic material.

99
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:49,041
If mutations were the only
source of variation, then I

100
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:53,089
could just bud off other Sals.

101
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:58,063
Maybe just other Sals would just
bud off from me, and then

102
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:01,055
randomly one Sal might be a
little bit different and

103
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,031
whatever else.

104
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:04,062
But that would, as we already
talked about, most of the

105
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:06,073
time, we would have very little
change, very little

106
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,050
variation, and whatever
variation does occur because

107
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,016
of any kind of noise being
introduced into this kind of

108
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:17,064
budding process where I just
replicate myself identically,

109
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,010
most of the time it'll
be negative.

110
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,079
Most of the time, it'll
break the organism.

111
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,066
Now, when you have sexual
reproduction, what happens?

112
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:27,037
Well, you keep mixing and
matching every possible

113
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:35,075
combination of DNA in a kind
of species pool of DNA.

114
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:39,050
So let me make this a little
bit more concrete for you.

115
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,077
So let me erase this horrible
drawing I just did.

116
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:47,030
So we all have-- let me stick
to humans because

117
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,055
that's what we are.

118
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,087


119
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:56,069
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes,
and in each pair,

120
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,020
we have one chromosome from our
mother and one chromosome

121
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,055
from our father.

122
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,047
So let me draw that.

123
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,088
So I'll draw my father's
chromosomes in blue.

124
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:15,026
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15--

125
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,027
I'm running out of space.

126
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:25,041
Let me do more here-- 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then

127
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,076
I'll throw another one
here that looks

128
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:27,097
a little bit different.

129
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:30,066
I'll throw one here that looks
like a Y, and we'll talk more

130
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,033
about the X's and the
Y chromosomes.

131
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:35,087
Then I have 23 chromosomes
from my mother.

132
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:39,047
And not to be stereotypical,
but maybe I'll do that in a

133
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,022
more feminine color.

134
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:44,036
Let's see, so I have 23
chromosomes from my mother.

135
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:56,048
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

136
00:06:56,048 --> 00:07:02,074
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

137
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,073
So what's going on here?

138
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:07,087
I have 23 from my mother.

139
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:14,062
I have 23 from my father.

140
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:18,006
Now, each of these chromosomes,
and I made them

141
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,031
right next to each other.

142
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:24,087
So let me zoom in on
one pair of these.

143
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:28,038
So let's say we look at
chromosome number-- I'll just

144
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:31,033
call this chromosome number 3.

145
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,014
So let me zoom in on chromosome
number 3.

146
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:36,032
I have one from my mother
right here.

147
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,064
Actually, maybe I'll
do it this way.

148
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:43,023
Remember, chromosome is just a
big-- if you take the DNA, the

149
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:45,093
DNA just keeps wrapping around,
and it actually wraps

150
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:48,010
around all these proteins, and
it creates this structure, but

151
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,043
it's just a big-- when you see
it like that, you're like, oh,

152
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:53,086
maybe the DNA-- no, but this
could have millions of base

153
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:56,000
pair, so maybe it'll look
something like that.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,010
It's a densely wrapped version
of-- well, it's a long string

155
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,023
of DNA, and when it's normally
drawn like this, which is not

156
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:06,063
always the way it is, and we'll
talk more about that,

157
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,024
they draw it as densely
packed like that.

158
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,017
So let's say that's
from my mother and

159
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,099
that's from my father.

160
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:21,012
Now, let's call this
chromosome 3.

161
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,068
They're both chromosome 3.

162
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,026
And what the idea here is that
I'm getting different traits

163
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:28,041
from my father and
from my mother.

164
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,099
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification here, but

165
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,062
this is really just to
give you the idea of

166
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:35,007
what's going on.

167
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,082
This chromosome 3, maybe
it contains this

168
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,046
trait for hair color.

169
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:45,092
And maybe my father had-- and
I'll use my actual example.

170
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,047
My father had very
straight hair.

171
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:53,052
So someplace on this chromosome,
there's a gene for

172
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,047
hair straightness.

173
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,021
Let's say it's a little
thing right there.

174
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:58,061
And remember, that gene could
be thousands of base pairs,

175
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,053
but let's say this is
hair straightness.

176
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:05,036
So my father's version of that
gene, he had the allele for

177
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:05,079
straightness.

178
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,023
And remember, an allele is just
a version of a gene, so

179
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:13,079
I'll call it the allele straight
for straight hair.

180
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,058


181
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:21,076
Now, this other chromosome that
my mother gave me, this

182
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,014
essentially, and there are
exceptions, but for the most

183
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:26,075
part, it codes for the same
genes, and that's why I put

184
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,086
them next to each other.

185
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:31,021
So this will also have the gene
for hair straightness or

186
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,051
curlyness, but my mom
does happen to

187
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,060
actually have curly hair.

188
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,025
So she has the gene right
there for curly hair.

189
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:43,070
The version of the gene
here is allele curly.

190
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,061
The gene just says, look, this
is the gene for whether or not

191
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,060
your hair is curly.

192
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,050
Each version of the gene
is called an allele.

193
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,063
Allele curly.

194
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:56,069
Now, when I got both of these in
my body or in my cells, and

195
00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:00,003
this is in every cell of my
body, every cell of my body

196
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:04,008
except for, and we'll talk in
a few seconds about my germ

197
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:07,033
cells, but every cells other
than the ones that I use for

198
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:12,005
reproduction have this complete
set of chromosomes in

199
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:13,033
it, which I find amazing.

200
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:17,069
But only certain chromosomes--
for example, these genes will

201
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:20,036
be completely useless in my
fingernails, because all of a

202
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,075
sudden, the straight and the
curly don't matter that much.

203
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:23,087
And I'm simplifying.

204
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:25,098
Maybe they will on some
other dimension.

205
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:27,070
But let's say for simplicity,
they won't

206
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,085
matter in certain places.

207
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,024
So certain genes are expressed
in certain parts of the body,

208
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:35,060
but every one of your body
cells, and we call those

209
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,098
somatic cells, and we'll
separate those from the sex

210
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:45,004
sells or the germs that we'll
talk about later.

211
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:48,005
So this is my body cells.

212
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,022
So this is the great majority
of your cells, and this is

213
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,002
opposed to your germ cells.

214
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:54,008
And the germ cells-- I'll just
write it here, just so you get

215
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:58,095
a clear-- for a male, that's
the sperm cells, and for

216
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:01,021
female that's the egg
cells, or the ova.

217
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,054


218
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:09,030
But most of my cells have a
complete collection of these,

219
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,037
and what I want to give you
the idea is that for every

220
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:16,020
trait, I essentially have two
versions: one from my mother

221
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,062
and one from my father.

222
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:21,006
Now, these right here are called
homologous chromosomes.

223
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:25,077


224
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:32,084
What that means is every time
you see this prefix homologous

225
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:35,085
or if you see like Homo sapiens
or even the word

226
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:41,011
homosexual or homogeneous,
it means same, right?

227
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,063
You see that all the time.

228
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:46,099
So homologous means that they're
almost the same.

229
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:52,023
They're coding for the most part
the same set of genes,

230
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:55,010
but they're not identical.

231
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,095
They actually might code for
slightly different versions of

232
00:11:58,095 --> 00:11:59,065
the same gene.

233
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:02,091
So depending on what versions
I get, what is actually

234
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:06,012
expressed for me, so my
genotype-- let me introduce

235
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:08,094
another word, and
I'm overwhelming

236
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,049
you with words here.

237
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:17,062
So my genotype is exactly what
alleles I have, what versions

238
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:18,016
of the gene.

239
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:21,021
So I got like the fifth version
of the curly allele.

240
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:23,085
There could be multiple versions
of the curly allele

241
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,049
in our gene pool.

242
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,082
And maybe I got some version
of the straight allele.

243
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:29,098
That is my genotype.

244
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:36,016
My phenotype is what my hair
really looks like.

245
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:39,072
So, for example, two people
could have different genotypes

246
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,087
with the same-- they might
code for hair that looks

247
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,055
pretty much the same,
so it might have a

248
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,087
very similar phenotype.

249
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:48,098
So one phenotype can be

250
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:50,063
represented by multiple genotypes.

251
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:53,069
So that's just one thing to
think about, and we'll talk a

252
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,077
lot about that in the future,
but I just wanted to introduce

253
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:57,037
you to that there.

254
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:01,020
Now, I entered this whole
discussion because I wanted to

255
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,042
talk about variation.

256
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,057
So how does variation happen?

257
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:09,012
Well, what's going to happen
when I-- well, let

258
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:09,063
me put it this way.

259
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:11,028
What's going to happen
when I reproduce?

260
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:13,099
And I have. I have a son.

261
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:18,015
Well, my contribution to my son
is going to be a random

262
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:22,052
collection of half
of these genes.

263
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,083
For each homologous pair, I'm
either going to contribute the

264
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,074
one that I got from my mother or
the one that I got from my

265
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,025
father, right?

266
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:37,036
So let's say that the sperm cell
that went on to fertilize

267
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:43,044
my wife's egg, let's say it
happened to have that one,

268
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,039
that one, or I could
just pick one from

269
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,083
each of these 23 sets.

270
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,001
And you say, well, how many
combinations are there?

271
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:56,024
Well, for every set, I could
pick one of the two homologous

272
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:59,054
chromosomes, and I'm going
to do that 23 times.

273
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,036
2 times 2 times 2, so that's
2 to the twenty third.

274
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:09,022
So 2 to the 23 different
versions that I can contribute

275
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:12,079
to any son or daughter that I
might have. We'll talk about

276
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,030
how that happens when we talk
about meiosis or mitosis, that

277
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,065
when I generate my sperm cells,
sperm cells essentially

278
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:26,059
takes one-- instead of having
23 pairs of chromosomes in

279
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:29,053
sperm, you only have
23 chromosomes.

280
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:32,075
So, for example, I'll take one
from each of those, and

281
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,002
through the process of meiosis,
which we'll go into,

282
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:37,020
I'll generate a bunch
of sperm cells.

283
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:44,074
And each sperm cell will have
one from each of these pairs,

284
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,044
one version from each
of those pairs.

285
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:51,098
So maybe for this chromosome I
get it from my dad, from the

286
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,037
next chromosome, I get
it from my mom.

287
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,084
Then I donate a couple more
from-- I should've drawn them

288
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,082
next to each other.

289
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:59,058
I donate a couple more
from my mom.

290
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:03,053
Then for chromosome number 5,
it comes from my dad, and so

291
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,020
on and so forth.

292
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
But there's 2 to the
twenty-third combinations

293
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,024
here, because there
are 23 pairs that

294
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,028
I'm collecting from.

295
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:13,052
Now, my wife's egg is going to
have the same situation.

296
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:17,060
There are 2 to the 23 different
combinations of DNA

297
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,073
that she can contribute just
based on which of the

298
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:24,059
homologous pairs she
will contribute.

299
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,038
So the possible combinations
that just one couple can

300
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:34,099
produce, and I'm using my life
as an example, but this

301
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,098
applies to everything.

302
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:39,042
This applies to every species
that experiences sexual

303
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,019
reproduction.

304
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,027
So if I can give 2 to
twenty-third combinations of

305
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:50,062
DNA and my wife can give 2 to
the 23 combinations of DNA,

306
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:55,024
then we can produce 2 to the
forty-sixth combinations.

307
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:58,022
Now, just to give an idea of how
large of a number this is,

308
00:15:58,022 --> 00:16:02,055
this is roughly 12,000 times the
number of human beings on

309
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:03,049
the planet today.

310
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:07,021
So there's a huge amount of
variation that even one couple

311
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,026
can produce.

312
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:12,025
And if you thought that even
that isn't enough, it turns

313
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,055
out that amongst these
homologous pairs, and we'll

314
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:18,050
talk about when this happens in
meiosis, you can actually

315
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,062
have DNA recombination.

316
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,045
And all that means is when these
homologous pairs during

317
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:27,073
meiosis line up near each other,
you can have this thing

318
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:32,034
called crossover, where all of
this DNA here crosses over and

319
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,042
touches over here, and all
this DNA crosses over and

320
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,020
touches over there.

321
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,054
So all of this goes there and
all of this goes there.

322
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:44,000
What you end up with after the
crossover is that one DNA, the

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,098
one that came from my mom, or
that I thought came from my

324
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:49,098
mom, now has a chunk that came
from my dad, and the chunk

325
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:55,014
that came from my dad, now has a
chunk that came from my mom.

326
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,070
Let me do that in
the right color.

327
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,011
It came from my mom like that.

328
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,098
And so that even increases the
amount of variety even more.

329
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:04,032
So you can almost now, instead
of talking about the different

330
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,014
chromosomes that you're
contributing where the

331
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:09,035
chromosomes are each of these
collections of DNA, you're now

332
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:11,057
talking about-- you can almost
go to the different

333
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:13,070
combinations at the gene level,
and now you can think

334
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,041
about it in almost infinite
form of variation.

335
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,091
You can think about all of the
variation that might emerge

336
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:23,072
when you start mixing and
matching different versions of

337
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:25,055
the same gene in a population.

338
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,015
And you don't just
look at one gene.

339
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:31,034
I mean, the reality is that
genes by themselves very

340
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:35,028
seldom code for a specific-- you
can very seldom look for

341
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:38,032
one gene and say, oh, that is
brown hair, or look for one

342
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:41,032
gene and say, oh, that's
intelligence, or that is how

343
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:42,054
likable someone is.

344
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:45,001
It's usually a whole set of
genes interacting in an

345
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,083
incredibly complicated way.

346
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,043
You know, hair might be coded
for by this whole set of genes

347
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,072
on multiple chromosomes and
this might be coded for a

348
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,088
whole set of genes on multiple
chromosomes.

349
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:56,063
And so then you can start
thinking about all of the

350
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:57,069
different combinations.

351
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,050
And then all of a sudden, maybe
some combination that

352
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,019
never existed before all of a
sudden emerges, and that's

353
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,045
very successful.

354
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:06,001
But I'll leave you to think
about it because maybe that

355
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,076
combination might be passed on,
or it may not be passed on

356
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:10,057
because of this recombination.

357
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,048
But we'll talk more about
that in the future.

358
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:15,072
But I wanted to introduce this
idea of sexual reproduction to

359
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:21,069
you, because this really is the
main source of variation

360
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,007
within a population.

361
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,073
To me, it's kind of a
philosophical idea, because we

362
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:31,057
almost take the idea of having
males and females for granted

363
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:34,007
because it's this
universal idea.

364
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,040
But I did a little reading on
it, and it turns out that this

365
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,030
actually only emerged about 1.4
billion years ago, that

366
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,081
this is almost a useful trait,
because once you introduce

367
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:48,035
this level of variation, the
natural selection can start--

368
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,029
you can kind of say that when
you have this more powerful

369
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,091
form of variation than just pure
mutations, and maybe you

370
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,053
might have some primitive form
of crossover before, but now

371
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,022
that you have this sexual
reproduction and you have this

372
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,098
variation, natural selection
can occur in a

373
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,031
more efficient way.

374
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:06,050
So that species that were able
to reproduce and essentially

375
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,065
recombine their DNA and mix and
match it in this way were

376
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,005
able to produce more variety and
were able to essentially

377
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:15,011
be selected for their
environment in a more

378
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:17,074
efficient way so they started
to essentially outnumber the

379
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,004
ones that couldn't, so it
became a kind of very

380
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,072
universal trait.

381
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:24,075
But you could have imagined a
world, and there are science

382
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:27,018
fiction books written about
this, where you have three

383
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:30,016
genders, where you have gender
one, two, three.

384
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,041
You could have 10 genders.

385
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:36,003
It just happens to be that on
Earth, this notion of having

386
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:39,075
two genders turned out to be a
very efficient and stable way

387
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:42,064
of introducing variation
into a population.

388
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,006
So, hopefully, you found
that interesting.

389
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:46,014
In the next video, I'll go more
into the detail of how

390
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:49,078
exactly meiosis and
mitosis works.

391
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:50,084

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,051


2
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:02,089
What I want to do in this
video is review what we

3
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:07,054
learned from our chemistry
classes about oxidation and

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:10,044
the opposite of oxidation,
reduction.

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,050
And then see how what we learned
in our chemistry class

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,010
relates to the way that a
biologist or biochemist might

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,096
use these words.

8
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:20,026
And hopefully we'll see that
they're the same thing.

9
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:22,044
So just as a bit of review, if
you watched the chemistry

10
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:25,048
playlist. Oxidation, you can
view it-- and actually there's

11
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,095
a famous mnemonic for it.

12
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:35,097
It's: OIL RIG Where the oil
tells us that oxidation is

13
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:38,093
losing-- I put it in quotes
because you're not necessarily

14
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:41,042
losing the electrons; I'll
show you what I mean-- is

15
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,038
losing electrons.

16
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,063
This is what you should
have learned in

17
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:46,064
your chemistry class.

18
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:54,002
And then you also learned that
reduction is gaining.

19
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,092
And I'll put that in
quotes as well.

20
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:59,086
Is gaining electrons.

21
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:02,017
And I put that in quotes because
you're not necessarily

22
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,039
gaining electrons.

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,085
You're more hogging it.

24
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:07,018
And the reason why it's called
reduction, is because if you

25
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:11,040
are gaining electrons your
notional charge, if you really

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,093
were gaining them,
is being reduced.

27
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:16,039
And the reason why this is
called oxidizing is because

28
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:19,000
you tend to lose electrons
to oxygen.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,092
Although it doesn't
have to be oxygen.

30
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,081
It could be any molecule
that will hog

31
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,084
electrons away from you.

32
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:28,015
And I think a nice example would
be fair to kind of make

33
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,076
this a little bit
more concrete.

34
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:33,076
Let's say I took some molecular
hydrogen, it's in a

35
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:37,018
gaseous state, and I were to
combust that with some

36
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:39,003
molecular oxygen.

37
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,095
This is what happened
on the Hindenburg.

38
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:43,046
They filled a balloon full of
hydrogen and you get a little

39
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:45,062
bit of spark, expose it to
oxygen, and you're going to

40
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:47,004
have a big explosion.

41
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,004
But in the process, for every
mole of molecular oxygen, if

42
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,006
you have two moles of molecular
hydrogen-- I'm just

43
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,006
making sure the equation is
balanced-- you're going to

44
00:01:55,006 --> 00:02:01,006
produce two moles of H2O
plus a ton of heat.

45
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,043
This thing is really
going to blow.

46
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:06,079


47
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,022
What I want to do, I mean
we could talk about the

48
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:10,018
Hindenburg but really, the whole
reason why I even wrote

49
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:13,053
this is, I want to show you what
is getting oxidized and

50
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:15,059
what is getting reduced.

51
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:18,075
So in this situation right
here on the hydrogen, the

52
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,062
molecular hydrogen just
looks like this.

53
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:23,065
You have a hydrogen-hydrogen
bond.

54
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,053
They're each sharing an electron
with the other one so

55
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,084
that they both can pretend
their 1s orbital

56
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,025
is completely filled.

57
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,018
So they're not losing electrons
to each other.

58
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,049
They're not hogging electrons
one from the other.

59
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,050
So we say that they have a
neutral oxidative state.

60
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,040
They haven't gained
or lost electrons.

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,053
They're just sharing them.

62
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:40,068
And the same thing is true
for the molecular oxygen.

63
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:42,091
And here you actually
have a double bond

64
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,088
with the two oxygens.

65
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:46,031
But they're both oxygens, so
there's no reason why one

66
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,024
would gain or lose electrons
from the other.

67
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:53,059
But when you go on this side
of the equation, something

68
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,043
interesting happens.

69
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:58,008
You have, for every oxygen is
connected to two hydrogens.

70
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:02,006


71
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,078
And the way to think about is
that oxygen is hogging each of

72
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,063
these hydrogen's electrons.

73
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,028
So hydrogen has this one
electron on its valence shell.

74
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,090
The deal with most covalent
bonding is, hey, I give you an

75
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,090
electron, you give me an
electron and we both have a

76
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,093
complete pair.

77
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:20,015
But we know, or hopefully we
can review, that oxygen is

78
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:23,050
much more electronegative
than hydrogen.

79
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,018
This is a little bit of glucose
that's left over from

80
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:29,015
our cellular restoration
video.

81
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:32,006
You can ignore it for now but
I'm going to connect all this

82
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:32,087
in a future video.

83
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,099
But if we look at our periodic
table, if you remember from

84
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,050
the chemistry playlist,
electronegativity increases as

85
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,046
we go to the top right of
the periodic table.

86
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:46,021
These are the most
electronegative elements over

87
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,068
here, these are the least
electronegative.

88
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:51,024
And all electronegative means
is, likes to hog electrons.

89
00:03:51,024 --> 00:04:03,072


90
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:07,018
So even though oxygen and
hydrogen are in a covalent

91
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:10,094
bond in water-- they're sharing
electrons-- oxygen is

92
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:13,058
more electronegative, much
more electronegative than

93
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,074
hydrogen, so it's going
to hog the electrons.

94
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:18,001
And actually if you take some
elements on this side and you

95
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:21,088
bond them with some guys over
here, these guys are so much

96
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:24,007
more electronegative than these
left-hand elements that

97
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:27,010
they'll actually completely
steal the electron, not just

98
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,012
hog it for most of the time.

99
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,099
But when you talk
electronegativity, it just

100
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:33,041
means, likes the electrons.

101
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,080
So when you look at this bond
between hydrogen and oxygen,

102
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,030
we saw from the periodic table,
oxygen is a lot more

103
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,027
electronegative, so the
electrons spend a lot more

104
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,087
time on oxygen.

105
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:46,018
We learned about hydrogen
bonding.

106
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,077
We learned that it creates a
partial negative charge on

107
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:52,062
that side of the water molecule
and creates partial

108
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:54,081
positive charges on this side.

109
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,075
And electrons still show
up around the hydrogens

110
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,093
every now and then.

111
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:01,045
When you talk about oxidation
and reduction you say, look

112
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:03,012
there's no partial charge.

113
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:07,011
If one guy is kind of hogging
the electron more, for the

114
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:10,088
sake of oxidation states, we're
going to assume that he

115
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:12,047
took the electron.

116
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:16,057
So for an oxidation state, we'll
assume that the oxygen

117
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:19,022
in water takes the electron
and we'll give him an

118
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:22,074
oxidation state of one minus.

119
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:25,060
Or the convention is, you write
the charge after the

120
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,095
number for oxidation states.

121
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:29,068
So you don't confuse it
with actual charges.

122
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:32,020
So this has a one minus because,
from an oxidation

123
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,011
state point of view, it's
taking the electron.

124
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,062
It's gaining the elctron.

125
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,094
That's why I put it in quotes.

126
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:38,036
Because you're not really
gaining it.

127
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,016
You're just gaining it
most of the time.

128
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,018
You're hogging electrons.

129
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:45,037
And likewise, this hydrogen--
let me be careful, this

130
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:48,043
isn't-- he got one electron from
this hydrogen and you got

131
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,094
another electron from
this hydrogen.

132
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:52,088
So instead of saying one minus,
it should be two minus.

133
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:55,058
It should be two minus, because
he's hogging one

134
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:58,013
electron from here and one
electron from there.

135
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:02,056
And in general, when oxygen is
bonding with other non-oxygen

136
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:06,098
atoms or non-oxygen elements,
it tends to have a two minus

137
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:10,005
or a negative two
oxidation state.

138
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,085
So if this guy's two
minus, because

139
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:14,025
he's gained two electrons.

140
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,087
Let me write that in quotes.

141
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:18,070
Gained two electrons.

142
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,092
We know that he really didn't
gain them, that he's just

143
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:21,083
hogging them.

144
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,079
These guys lost an
electron each.

145
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,024
So this guy's oxidation state
is going to be one plus.

146
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:32,083
And this guy's oxidation state
is going to be one plus.

147
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,093
So you could say, by combusting
the hydrogen with

148
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:39,006
the oxygen, that the hydrogens--
before they had a

149
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,012
zero oxygen state, each of these
hydrogens had a zero

150
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:45,041
oxygen state-- now they have
a one plus oxidation state

151
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,066
because they lost their
electrons when they bonded

152
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,066
with the oxygen.

153
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:51,054
So we say that these hydrogens
have been oxidized.

154
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:56,079


155
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:05,026
So, due to this reaction,
hydrogen has been oxidized.

156
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:06,087
Why has it been oxidized?

157
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,072
Because before, it was
able to share its

158
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,024
electrons very nicely.

159
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:13,020
But then it bonds with oxygen,
which will hog its electrons.

160
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,077
So the hydrogen is losing its
electrons to the oxygen, so

161
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,031
it's been oxidized.

162
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:25,026
Similarly, the oxygen, due to
this combustion reaction, has

163
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:31,006
been reduced.

164
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,012
Why has it been reduced?

165
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:33,085
Here it was just sharing
electrons.

166
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,032
It wasn't losing
or gaining it.

167
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:39,058
But here when it's bonded with
an element with much lower

168
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,045
electronegativity, all of a
sudden it can start hogging

169
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,044
the electrons, it
gains electrons.

170
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:47,078
So this hypothetical charge
is reduced by two.

171
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:50,041


172
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,005
And if I wanted to actually
account for all of the

173
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,017
electrons, because we're talking
about losing electrons

174
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,070
and gaining electrons, we can
write two half reactions.

175
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,027
This should all be a little
bit of review from your

176
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,002
chemistry class.

177
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,077
But it never hurts to
see this again.

178
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm going to throw this in the
biology playlist so that you

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,026
biology people can hopefully
refresh your

180
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:10,000
memory with this stuff.

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,043
We can write two
half reactions.

182
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:15,083
We could say that we started
off with two moles of

183
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,014
molecular hydrogen.

184
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:21,014
And they have no oxidation
states, or they're neutral.

185
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,000
So I could write a zero
there if I want.

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,001
And then I end up with-- on the
other side-- I end up with

187
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,033
two moles of H2.

188
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:33,075
But each of the hydrogens
now, have a plus

189
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,000
one oxidation state.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,017


191
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,058
Or another way to think about it
is, each of these-- there's

192
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,094
four hydrogens here.

193
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:45,037
This is molecular hydrogen has
two hydrogens and we have two

194
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:46,004
moles of this.

195
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,064
So there are four
hydrogens here.

196
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:50,048
Each of the four hydrogens
lost an electron.

197
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:51,015
So I can write this.

198
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:54,052
So, plus four electrons.

199
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:56,046
That's the half reaction
for hydrogen.

200
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:58,063
It lost four electrons.

201
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:05,029
So this is another way of
saying that hydrogen is

202
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,000
oxidized because it
lost electrons.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,020
OIL: oxidation is losing.

204
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,047
And then the other half
reaction, if I were to write

205
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,075
the oxygen.

206
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:21,063
So I'm starting with a mole of
molecular oxygen and I'm

207
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:24,057
adding to that four electrons.

208
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,097
I can't make electrons
out of nowhere.

209
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,003
I'm getting the electrons from
the hydrogen, I'm adding to

210
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:29,024
the oxygen.

211
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:35,055
And so the half reaction on this
side, I end up with two

212
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:38,064
moles-- I could write it like
this-- two moles of oxygen.

213
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:43,084
And each of them have an
oxidation state of two minus.

214
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,008
So these are the
half reactions.

215
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:47,062
And all this is showing is that
the hydrogen, over the

216
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:50,030
course of this combustion
reaction, lost electrons.

217
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,083
And that the oxygen gained the
electrons that the hydrogen

218
00:09:53,083 --> 00:10:02,037
lost. So this tells us that
oxygen is reduced.

219
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:05,012
Now this is all fair and good
and this is all a bit of

220
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:07,040
review of what you learned
in chemistry class.

221
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,051
But now I'm going to make things
even more confusing.

222
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,076
Because I'm going to introduce
you to how a biologist

223
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,073
thinks about it.

224
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:14,035
So-- and it's not
always the case.

225
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,044
Sometimes the biologist will use
the definition you learned

226
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:17,072
in your chemistry class.

227
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:20,071
But a biologist-- or many
times in many biology

228
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:23,091
textbooks-- they'll say-- and
this used to confuse me to no

229
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:39,022
end, really-- that oxidation is
losing hydrogen atoms. And

230
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:52,021
reduction is gaining
hydrogen atoms.

231
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,057
And at first when I got exposed
to this, I was like, I

232
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:57,019
learned it in chemistry class
and they talk about electrons.

233
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,027
Hydrogen atoms, you know it's a
proton and an electron, how

234
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,012
does it relate?

235
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:03,054
And the reason why these two
definitions-- this is really

236
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:05,046
the whole point of this video--
the reason why this

237
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:09,058
definition is consistent with
this one is because in the

238
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:21,019
biological world hydrogen
is what tends

239
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,023
to get swapped around.

240
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:27,097
And it tends to bond with
carbon, oxygen,

241
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:30,050
phosphorous, nitrogen.

242
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,057
And if we look at the periodic
table, and we see where

243
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:40,084
hydrogen is, and we see where
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and

244
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:43,070
phosphorous and really all this
other stuff is, you see

245
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,084
that all of the stuff that in
biological systems, hydrogen

246
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:50,057
tends to bond with, the things
it tends to bond with are

247
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,091
much, much more electronegative.

248
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:56,026
So if a carbon is bonding with
a hydrogen, the carbon is

249
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,074
hogging that electron.

250
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:00,061
And then if that hydrogen gets
transferred to an oxygen,

251
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:04,025
along with the electron, the
carbon will lose the hydrogen

252
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,022
atom, but it really lost
the electron that

253
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,045
it was hogging before.

254
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,094
And now the oxygen can
hog that electron.

255
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,099
So these are really consistent
definitions.

256
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,069
And the whole reason why I
showed you this example is

257
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:17,075
because the biological
definition doesn't apply here.

258
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:21,089
I mean, you could say, well,
oxygen is definitely gaining

259
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,064
hydrogens in this reaction.

260
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:27,000
So we can definitely say that
oxygen is being reduced still,

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,011
according to the biological
definition.

262
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,077
But you can't really say
that hydrogen is

263
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:34,074
losing hydrogens here.

264
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:37,084
In this situation, hydrogen
is just losing electrons.

265
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:39,028
It's not losing itself.

266
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:41,012
I guess you could say it's
losing itself because it's

267
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,009
being taken over.

268
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,091
But the biological definition
just comes

269
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,083
from the same notion.

270
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,045
That when hydrogen bonds with
most things in biological

271
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,051
compounds, it tends to
give the electrons.

272
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,074
So if a carbon loses a hydrogen
and gives it to an

273
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:56,094
oxygen, the carbon will lose
that hydrogen's electron that

274
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:58,016
it was able to hog.

275
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,085
And now the oxygen
is hogging it.

276
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:03,050
So the carbon would be oxidized
and the oxygen would

277
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,037
be reduced.

278
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:05,030
Hope that doesn't confuse you.

279
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,082
In the next video I'll show you
a couple more examples.

280
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:10,062
And the whole reason why I'm
doing this is to apply this to

281
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:12,009
cellular respiration.

282
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,035
So that you don't get confused
when people talk and say that,

283
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:20,071
oh the NAD is being reduced when
it picks up the hydrogen.

284
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:23,030
Or it's being oxidized when it
loses the hydrogen, and so

285
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,098
forth and so on.

286
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:26,002
I wanted you to see that these
are the same definitions that

287
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:28,053
you learned in your
chemistry class.

288
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:28,067

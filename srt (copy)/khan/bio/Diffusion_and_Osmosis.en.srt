1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,045


2
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:02,054
In this video, I want to
cover several topics

3
00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:03,064
that are all related.

4
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:05,084
And on some level, they're
really simple, but on a whole

5
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,088
other level, they tend to
confuse people a lot.

6
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:10,010
So hopefully we can
make some headway.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,040
So a good place to start-- let's
just imagine that I have

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,046
some type of container here.

9
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:18,012
Let's say that's my container
and inside of that container,

10
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:21,042
I have a bunch of
water molecules.

11
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:24,007
It's just got a bunch
of water molecules.

12
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,055
They're all rubbing against
each other.

13
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,092
It's in its liquid form,
this is liquid water.

14
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:30,033
and inside of the water
molecules, I

15
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,004
have some sugar molecules.

16
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,078
Maybe I'll do sugar in
this pink color.

17
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:40,068
So I have a bunch of sugar
molecules right here.

18
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:43,003
I have many, many more water
molecules though.

19
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:44,028
I want to make that clear.

20
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:49,042


21
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:55,065
Now in this type of situation,
we call the thing that there's

22
00:00:55,065 --> 00:01:00,043
more of, the solvent.

23
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:03,035
So in this case, there's more
water molecules and you can

24
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:07,098
literally just view more as
the number of molecules.

25
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:10,001
I'm not going to go into a whole
discussion of moles and

26
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:13,014
all of that because you may or
may not have been exposed to

27
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:15,067
that yet, but just imagine
whatever there's more of,

28
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,073
that's what we're going
to call the solvent.

29
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:24,062
So in this case, water
is the solvent.

30
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:30,003
And whatever there is less of--
in this case, that is the

31
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,073
sugar-- that is considered
the solute.

32
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:36,029


33
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,064
It doesn't have to be sugar.

34
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,031
It can be any molecule that
there's less of, in the water,

35
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,056
in this case.

36
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:45,075


37
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:49,062
And we say that the sugar has
been dissolved into the water.

38
00:01:49,062 --> 00:02:03,050


39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,042
And this whole thing right here,
the combination of the

40
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,022
water and the sugar molecules,
we call a solution.

41
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:14,013
We call this whole
thing a solution.

42
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,087
And a solution has the solvent
and the solute.

43
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,015
The solvent is water.

44
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:21,011
That's the thing doing the
dissolving and the thing that

45
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:23,021
is dissolved is the sugar.

46
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,028
That's the solute.

47
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:27,094
Now all of this may or may not
be review for you, but I'm

48
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:32,087
doing it for a reason-- because
I want to talk about

49
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,037
the idea of a diffusion.

50
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:39,096


51
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:43,049
And the idea is actually
pretty straightforward.

52
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,078
If I have, let's say,
the same container.

53
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:49,059
Let me do it in a slightly
different container here, just

54
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,063
to talk about diffusion.

55
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:52,018
We'll go back to water
and sugar--

56
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,006
especially back to water.

57
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:58,056
Let's say we have a container
here and let's say it just has

58
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,083
a bunch of-- let's say it just
has some air particles in it.

59
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,056
It could be anything-- oxygen
or carbon dioxide.

60
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:07,087
So let me just draw a couple
of air molecules here.

61
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:11,006
So let's say that that is a
gaseous-- just for the sake of

62
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,059
argument-- gaseous oxygen.

63
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,090
So each of this is an O2--
each of those, right?

64
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,090
And let's say that this is the
current configuration, that

65
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,071
all of this is a vacuum here
and that there's some

66
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,021
temperatures.

67
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,049
So these water molecules,
they have some

68
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,028
type of kinetic energy.

69
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:29,062
They're moving in some type of
random directions right there.

70
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:34,075
So my question is, what is going
to happen in this type

71
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:35,081
of container?

72
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,071
Well, any of these guys are
going to be randomly bumping

73
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,077
into each other.

74
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:43,003
They're more likely to bump into
things in this down-left

75
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,012
direction than they are in
the up-right direction.

76
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,096
So if this guy was happening
to go in this down-left

77
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:50,011
direction, he's going to bump
into something and then

78
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:52,006
ricochet into the up-right
direction.

79
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:53,047
But in the up-right
direction, there's

80
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,003
nothing to bounce into.

81
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,099
So in general, everything is
moving in random directions,

82
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,025
but you're more likely
to be able to move in

83
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,000
the rightward direction.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,050
When you go to the left, you're
more likely to bump

85
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,012
into something.

86
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:06,009
So it's almost common sense.

87
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,055
Over time, if you just let this
system come to some type

88
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,058
of equilibrium-- I'm not
going to go into detail

89
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,034
on what that means.

90
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,034
You can watch the thermodynamics
videos if you'd

91
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,046
like to see that.

92
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,000
You'll eventually see the
container will look

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,013
something like this.

94
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:20,019
I can't guarantee it.

95
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,050
There's some probability it
would actually stay like this,

96
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,092
but very likely that those five
particles are going to

97
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,097
get relatively spread out.

98
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:32,079
This is diffusion and so it's
really just the spreading of

99
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,093
particles or molecules from
high concentration to low

100
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:39,013
concentration areas, right?

101
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,042
In this case, the molecules are
going to spread in that

102
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:43,077
direction from a high
concentration to a low

103
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:45,012
concentration area.

104
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,092
Now you're saying, Sal,
what is concentration?

105
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:51,006
And there's many ways to measure
concentration and you

106
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:54,012
can go into molarity and
molality and all of that.

107
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:57,082
But the very simple idea is, how
much of that particle do

108
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,089
you have per unit space?

109
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:02,077
So here, you have a lot of those
particles per unit space

110
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:04,055
and here you have very
few of those

111
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,085
particles per unit space.

112
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:09,023
So this is a high concentration
and that's a low

113
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:09,097
concentration.

114
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:12,074
So you could imagine other
experiments like this.

115
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:17,000
You could imagine a solution
like-- let's do

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,025
something like this.

117
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:21,056


118
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:22,081
Let's say I have
two containers.

119
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,043


120
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,023
Let's go back to the
solution situation.

121
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,072
This was a gas, but I started
off with that example so let's

122
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,043
stay with that example.

123
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:35,052
So let's say that I have a door
right there that's larger

124
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:38,037
than either the water or
the sugar molecules.

125
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,030
On either side, I have a bunch
of water molecules.

126
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:52,001


127
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,030
So I have a lot of
water molecules.

128
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,064
So if I just had water molecules
here-- they're all

129
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,068
bouncing around in random
directions-- and so the odds

130
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:01,088
of a water molecule going this
way, equivalent to odds of a

131
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,058
water molecule going that way,
assuming that both sides have

132
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:06,056
the same level of water
molecule, otherwise the

133
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,050
pressures would be different.

134
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,006
But let's say that the top
of this is the same

135
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:11,017
as the top of this.

136
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,073
So there's no more pressure
going in one

137
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,079
direction or another.

138
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,024
So if for whatever reason, a
bunch more water molecules

139
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,077
were going in the rightward
direction, then all of a

140
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,075
sudden this would fill up with
more water and we know that

141
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,062
that isn't likely to occur.

142
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:28,019
So this is just two containers
of water.

143
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,033
Now let's put some
solute in it.

144
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,023
Let's dissolve some solute in it
and let's say we do all the

145
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,062
dissolving on the
left-hand side.

146
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:40,062
So we put some sugar molecules
on the left-hand side.

147
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,091
And these are small enough to
fit through this little pipe.

148
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:44,027
That's one assumption
that I'm making.

149
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,012
So what's going to happen?

150
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,070
All of these things have some
type of kinetic energy.

151
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,062
They're all bouncing around.

152
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:56,025
Well, over time, the water's
going back and forth.

153
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,060
This water molecule
might go that way.

154
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,004
That water molecule might go
that way, but they net each

155
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,081
other out, but over time one of
these big sugar molecules

156
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,051
will be going in just the
right direction to go

157
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,047
through-- maybe this guy's,
instead of going that

158
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,037
direction, he starts off going
in that direction.

159
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:15,062
He goes just through this tunnel
connecting the two

160
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:18,005
containers and he'll end
up there, right?

161
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,031
And this guy will still
be bouncing around.

162
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:23,056
There's some probability he goes
back, but there's still

163
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:25,042
more sugar particles
here than there.

164
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:31,035
So there's still more
probability that one of these

165
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,035
guys will go to that side
than one of these guys

166
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,033
will go to that side.

167
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,098
So you can imagine if you're
doing this with gazillions of

168
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:40,064
particles-- I'm only doing it
with four-- over time, the

169
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:43,043
particles will have spread out
so that their concentrations

170
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,055
are roughly equal.

171
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,094
So that maybe you'll have
two here over time.

172
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:49,043
But when you're only dealing
with three or four or five

173
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:51,037
particles, there's some
probability it doesn't happen,

174
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,024
but when you're doing it with a
gazillion and they're super

175
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:56,081
small, it's a very, very,
very high likelihood.

176
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:59,058
But anyway, this whole process--
we went from a

177
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:02,045
container of high concentration
to a container

178
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:06,007
of low concentration and the
particles would have spread

179
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,052
from the low concentration
container to the high

180
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,058
concentration container.

181
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,012
So they diffused.

182
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,081
This is diffusion.

183
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:16,017


184
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,087
And just so that we learn some
other words that tend to be

185
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:21,080
used with the idea of
diffusion-- when we started

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,025
off, this had a higher
concentration.

187
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,071
The left-hand side container
had higher concentration.

188
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:33,011


189
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,012
It's all relative, right?

190
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:37,048
It's higher than this guy.

191
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,050
And this right here had
a lower concentration.

192
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,079


193
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,045
And there are words
for these things.

194
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:47,064
This solution with a high
concentration is called a

195
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:50,033
hypertonic solution.

196
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,073
Let me write that in yellow.

197
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:58,033


198
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,012
Hyper, in general, meaning
having a lot of something,

199
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,062
having too much of something.

200
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:05,092
And this lower concentration
is hypotonic.

201
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:13,072


202
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:16,065
You might have heard maybe one
of your relatives, if they

203
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:20,073
haven't had a meal in awhile
say, I'm hypoglycemic.

204
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,023
That means that they have
not-- they're feeling

205
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:22,090
lightheaded.

206
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,079
There's not enough sugar in
their bloodstream and they

207
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,073
want to pass out so
they want a meal.

208
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:29,092
If you just had a candy bar,
maybe you're hyperglycemic--

209
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:32,092
or maybe you're just
hyper in general.

210
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,058
So these are just good
prefixes to know, but

211
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:38,064
hypertonic-- you have
a lot of the solute.

212
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:40,050
You have a high concentration.

213
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,050
And then in hypotonic, not too
much of the solute so you have

214
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,000
a low concentration.

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,012
These are good words to know.

216
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:51,022
So in general, diffusion-- if
there's no barriers to the

217
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:54,078
diffusion like we had here, you
will have the solute go

218
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,082
from a high concentration or
hypertonic solution if they

219
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:03,049
can travel to a hypotonic
solution, to a hypo, where the

220
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,051
concentration is lower.

221
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:08,048
Now let's do an interesting
experiment here.

222
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,092
We've talked about diffusion and
so far we've been talking

223
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:14,052
about the diffusion of
the solute, right?

224
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:17,076
And in general-- and this is not
always the case-- if you

225
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,077
want to be as general as
possible, the solute is

226
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,039
whatever you have less of,
the solvent is whatever

227
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,050
you have more of.

228
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,060
And the most common solvent
tends to be water, but it

229
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,051
doesn't have to be water.

230
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:28,087
It could be some type
of alcohol.

231
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,038
It could be mercury.

232
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:34,087
It could be a whole set of
molecules, but water in most

233
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:38,012
biological or chemical systems
tends to be the

234
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,046
most typical solvent.

235
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:41,091
It's what other things
are dissolved into.

236
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:46,037
But what happens if we have a
tunnel where the solute is too

237
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:51,005
big to travel, but water is
small enough to travel?

238
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:55,037
Let's think about
that situation.

239
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:57,009
In order to think about it,
I'm going to do something

240
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,083
interesting.

241
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,066
Let's say we have a
container here.

242
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,095
Actually, I won't even
draw a container.

243
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,019
Let's just say we have an
outside environment that has a

244
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,025
bunch of water.

245
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:12,062
This is the outside environment
and then you have

246
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,087
some type of membrane.

247
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:19,039


248
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,003
Water can go in and out
of this membrane.

249
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,019
So it's semi-permeable.

250
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,051
Well, it's permeable to water,
but the solute cannot go

251
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,011
through the membrane.

252
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:28,067
So let's say that the
solute is sugar.

253
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:33,005
So we have water on
the outside and

254
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:36,012
also inside the membrane.

255
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,037
So these are little small
water molecules.

256
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:43,095
This is a membrane right here.

257
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:46,051
And let's say that we have some
sugar molecules again--

258
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,055
I'm just picking on sugar.

259
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:48,075
It could have been anything.

260
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,004
So we have some sugar molecules
here that are just a

261
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:55,095
little bit bigger-- or they
could be a lot bigger.

262
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:57,075
Actually, they're a lot bigger
than water molecules.

263
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:59,070
You have a bunch of-- and I only
draw four, but you have a

264
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,021
gazillion of them, right?

265
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,047
You have that much more
water molecules.

266
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,032
I'm just trying to show you have
more water molecules than

267
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,028
sugar molecules.

268
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,064
And this membrane is
semi-permeable.

269
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:13,013


270
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,021
Permeable means it allows
things to pass.

271
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:18,007
Semi-permeables means it's
not completely permeable.

272
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:20,064
So semi-permeable-- in this
context, I'm saying I allow

273
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:22,044
water to pass through
the membrane.

274
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:28,085
So water can pass,
but sugar cannot.

275
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,010
Sugar is too large.

276
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,089


277
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,022
So if we were to zoom in on the
actual membrane itself--

278
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,058
maybe the membrane
looks like this.

279
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,098
I'm going to zoom in
on this membrane.

280
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:44,052


281
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:48,062
So it has little holes in the
membrane, just like that.

282
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:51,026
And maybe the water molecules
are about that size.

283
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,082
So they can go through
those holes.

284
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,025
So the water molecules can go
back and forth through the

285
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:01,051
holes, but the sugar molecules
are about that big.

286
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:04,099
So they cannot go through
that hole.

287
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,027
They're too big for this opening
right here to go back

288
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,083
and forth between them.

289
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:12,067
Now what do you think is going
to happen in this situation?

290
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,033
So first of all, let's
use our terminology.

291
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,072
Remember, sugar is our solute.

292
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,012
Water is our solvent.

293
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,092
Semi-permeable membrane.

294
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:21,039
Which side of the membrane
has a higher or lower

295
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,033
concentration of solute?

296
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,069
Well, the inside does.

297
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,005
The inside is hypertonic.

298
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:32,037


299
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,053
The outside has a lower

300
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:34,085
concentration so it's hypotonic.

301
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:44,085


302
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:47,067
Now, if these openings were big
enough, based on what we

303
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:51,033
just talked about-- these guys
are bouncing around, water is

304
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,070
travelling in either direction,
and equal

305
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,051
probability or-- actually
I'm going to talk

306
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,036
about that in a second.

307
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:01,065
If everything was wide open, it
would be equal probability,

308
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:03,077
but if it was wide open, these
guys eventually would bounce

309
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:06,045
their ways over to this side and
you'd probably end up with

310
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,050
equal concentrations
eventually.

311
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,071
And so you would have your
traditional diffusion, where

312
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:13,012
high concentration
of solute to low

313
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,052
concentrations of solute.

314
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,035
But in this case, these
guys-- they can't

315
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:18,033
fit through the hole.

316
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,015
Only water can go
back and forth.

317
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:25,017
If these guys were not here,
water would have an equal

318
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:28,077
likelihood of going in this
direction as they would be

319
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:33,094
going in that direction, a
completely equal likelihood.

320
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:40,009
But because these guys are on
the right-hand side of-- or in

321
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:42,028
this case, on the inside
of our membrane.

322
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:47,000
This is our inside of our
membrane zoomed up-- it's less

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,044
likely because these guys
might be in the approach

324
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:55,023
position of the holes-- that's
slightly less likely for water

325
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:58,011
to be in the approach position
for the holes so it's actually

326
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:02,072
more probable that water could
enter than water exit.

327
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:04,017
And I want to make
that very clear.

328
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,014
If these sugar molecules were
not here, obviously it's

329
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,083
equally likely for water to
go in either direction.

330
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,073
Now that these sugar molecules
are there, these sugar

331
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:15,028
molecules might be on
the right-hand side.

332
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:18,020
They might be blocking-- I guess
the best way to think

333
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,042
about it is blocking the
approach to the hole.

334
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,005
They'll never be able to go
through the hole themselves

335
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,049
and might not even be blocking
the hole, but they're going in

336
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,072
some random direction.

337
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:29,058
So if a water molecule was
approaching-- it's all

338
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,036
probabilistic and we're dealing
with gazillions of

339
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:34,061
molecules-- it's that much more
likely to be blocked to

340
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:35,036
get outside.

341
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,062
But the water molecules from the
outside-- there's nothing

342
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,016
blocking them to get in so
you're going to have a flow of

343
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,048
water inside.

344
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:44,030
So in this situation, with a
semi-permeable membrane,

345
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,070
you're going to have water.

346
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,027
You're going to have a net
inward flow of water.

347
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,042
And so this is kind
of interesting.

348
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:56,089
We have the solvent flowing from
a hypotonic situation to

349
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,060
a hypertonic solution,
but it's only

350
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,021
hypotonic in the solute.

351
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:07,064


352
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:11,062
But water-- if you flip it the
other way-- if you've used

353
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:15,028
sugar as the solvent, then you
could say, we're going from a

354
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:19,047
high concentration of water to
a low concentration of water.

355
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,037
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

356
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:23,009
This is what tends to confuse
people, but just think about

357
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,003
what's going to happen.

358
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:27,025
No matter in what situation,
the solution is going to do

359
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:30,000
what it can to try to
equilibriate the

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,067
concentration.

361
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,008
To make the concentrations
on both

362
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,071
sides as close as possible.

363
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:35,014
And it's not just some magic.

364
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:36,015
It's not like the
solution knows.

365
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:38,029
It's all based on probabilities
and these things

366
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,004
bumping around, but in this
situation, water is more

367
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:43,078
likely to flow into
the container.

368
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:46,070
So it's actually going to go
from the hypotonic side when

369
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,046
we talk about low concentration
of solute to the

370
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:53,069
side that has high
concentrations of solute, of

371
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:57,032
sugar-- and actually, if this
thing is stretchable, more

372
00:16:57,032 --> 00:17:01,066
water will keep flowing
in and this membrane

373
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,042
will stretch out.

374
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:08,042
I won't go to too much detail
here, but this idea of water--

375
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:12,047
of the solvent-- if in this
case, water is the solvent--

376
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:15,015
of water as a solvent
diffusing through a

377
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:18,050
semi-permeable membrane,
this is called osmosis.

378
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,056


379
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:25,017
You've probably heard learning
by osmosis-- if you put a book

380
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,020
against your head, maybe it'll
just seep into your brain.

381
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,000
Same idea.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,050
That's where the word
comes from.

383
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,056
This idea of water seeping
through membranes to try to

384
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:35,059
make concentrations
more equal.

385
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,036
So if you say, well, I have high
concentration here, low

386
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:39,049
concentration here.

387
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:43,001
If there was no membrane here,
these big molecules would

388
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:48,007
exit, but because there's this
semi-permeable membrane here,

389
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:48,068
they can't.

390
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:52,040
So the system just
probabilistically-- no magic

391
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,008
here-- more water will enter
to try to equilibriate

392
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,016
concentration.

393
00:17:57,016 --> 00:18:01,097
Eventually-- if maybe there's a
few molecules out here-- not

394
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:06,044
as high concentration here--
eventually if everything was

395
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,097
allowed to happen fully, you'll
get to the point where

396
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:11,011
you have just as many--
you have just as high

397
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,065
concentration on this side as
you have on the right-hand

398
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:16,050
side because this right-hand
side is going to fill with

399
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,038
water and also probably become
a larger volume.

400
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,051
And then, once again, the
probabilities of a water

401
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:23,059
molecule going to the right and
to the left will be the

402
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,092
same and you'll get to some
type of equilibrium.

403
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:29,091
But I want to make it very
clear-- diffusion is the idea

404
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:33,013
of any particle going from
higher concentration and

405
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,074
spreading into a region that has
a lower concentration and

406
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,095
just spreading out.

407
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:41,024
Osmosis is the diffusion
of water.

408
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:44,021
And usually you're talking about
the diffusion of water

409
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:47,000
as a solvent and usually it's
in the context of a

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,025
semi-permeable membrane, where
the actual solute cannot

411
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,052
travel through the membrane.

412
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:55,079
Anyway, hopefully you've
found that useful and

413
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,088
not completely confusing.

414
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,047

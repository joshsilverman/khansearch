1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,052


2
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:03,095
Where I left off in the last
video, we talked about how the

3
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:07,044
hemoglobin in red blood cells
is what sops up all of the

4
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:11,043
oxygen so that it increases the
diffusion gradient-- or it

5
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:14,080
increases the incentive, we
could say, for the oxygen to

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,075
go across the membrane.

7
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,039
We know that the oxygen
molecules don't know that

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,018
there's less oxygen here, but
if you watch the video on

9
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,017
diffusion you know how
that process happens.

10
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:25,083
If there's less concentration
here than there, the oxygen

11
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:29,007
will diffuse across the membrane
and there's less

12
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:33,000
inside the plasma because the
hemoglobin is sucking it all

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,050
up like a sponge.

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,006
Now, one interesting question
is, why does the hemoglobin

15
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:42,057
even have to reside within
the red blood cells?

16
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:45,067
Why aren't hemoglobin proteins
just freely floating in the

17
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,064
blood plasma?

18
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:48,006
That seems more efficient.

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,002
You don't have to have things
crossing through, in and out

20
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:53,021
of, these red blood
cell membranes.

21
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,038
You wouldn't have to make
red blood cells.

22
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:58,057
What's the use of having these
containers of hemoglobin?

23
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,092
It's actually a very
interesting idea.

24
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:04,051
If you had all of the hemoglobin
sitting in your

25
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,095
blood plasma, it would
actually hurt

26
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:08,045
the flow of the blood.

27
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:11,050
The blood would become more
viscous or more thick.

28
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,043
I don't want to say like syrup,
but it would become

29
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:16,051
thicker than blood is right
now-- and by packaging the

30
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:19,070
hemoglobin inside these
containers, inside the red

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,026
blood cells, what it allows
the blood to do

32
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:23,079
is flow a lot better.

33
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:26,060
Imagine if you wanted to
put syrup in water.

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,089
If you just put syrup
straight into water,

35
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,065
what's going to happen?

36
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:34,009
The water's going to become a
little syrupy, a little bit

37
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,051
more viscous and not
flow as well.

38
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,093
So what's the solution
if you wanted to

39
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:40,037
transport syrup in water?

40
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:43,093
Well, you could put the syrup
inside little containers or

41
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:47,014
inside little beads and then
let the beads flow in the

42
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:49,054
water and then the water
wouldn't be all gooey-- and

43
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:52,051
that's exactly what's happening
inside of our blood.

44
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,098
Instead of having the hemoglobin
sit in the plasma

45
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:58,043
and make it gooey, it sits
inside these beads that we

46
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:02,064
call red blood cells that allows
the flow to still be

47
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:04,042
non-viscous.

48
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:08,080
So I've been all zoomed in here
on the alveolus and these

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
capillaries, these pulmonary
capillaries-- let's zoom out a

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,091
little bit-- or zoom out a lot--
just to understand, how

51
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,012
is the blood flowing?

52
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,078
And get a better understanding
of pulmonary arteries and

53
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:22,091
veins relative to the other
arteries and veins

54
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,013
that are in the body.

55
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:29,074
So here-- I copied this from
Wikipedia, this diagram of the

56
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:32,081
human circulatory system--
and here in the back

57
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,031
you can see the lungs.

58
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:38,021
Let me do it in a
nice dark color.

59
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:39,087
So we have our lungs here.

60
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:44,059


61
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,088
You can see the heart is sitting
right in the middle.

62
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:49,011
And what we learned in the last
few videos is that we

63
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,025
have our little alveoli
and our lungs.

64
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:54,078
Remember, we get to them from
our bronchioles, which are

65
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:57,018
branching off of the bronchi,
which branch off of the

66
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,059
trachea, which connects to our
larynx, which connects to our

67
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,090
pharynx, which connects
to our mouth and nose.

68
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,034
But anyway, we have our little
alveoli right there and then

69
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,087
we have the capillaries.

70
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:15,044
So when we go away from the
heart-- and we're going to

71
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,090
delve a little bit into the
heart in this video as well--

72
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,013
so when blood travels away
from the heart, it's

73
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,012
de-oxygenated.

74
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,022
It's this blue color.

75
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:24,096
So this right here is blood.

76
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:27,005
This right here is blood
traveling away from the heart.

77
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,031
It's going behind these
two tubes right there.

78
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:33,022
So this is the blood going
away from the heart.

79
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:38,025
So this blue that I've been
highlighting just now, these

80
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:43,062
are the pulmonary arteries and
then they keep splitting into

81
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,090
arterials and all of that
and eventually we're in

82
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,059
capillaries-- super,
super small tubes.

83
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:52,068
They run right past the alveoli
and then they become

84
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:58,027
oxygenated and now we're going
back to the heart.

85
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:00,072
So we're talking about
pulmonary veins.

86
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,008
So we go back to the heart.

87
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,059
So these capillaries-- in the
capillaries we get oxygen.

88
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,059
Now we're going to go
back to the heart.

89
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:11,009
Hope you can see
what I'm doing.

90
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,044
And we're going to enter
the heart on this side.

91
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:16,070
You actually can't even
see where we're

92
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,029
entering the heart.

93
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,005
We're going to enter the heart
right over here-- and I'm

94
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,070
going to go into more
detail on that.

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,004
Now we have oxygenated blood.

96
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:23,085
It's red.

97
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:26,064
And then that gets pumped out
to the rest of the body.

98
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:30,048
Now this is the interesting
thing.

99
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,006
When we're talking about
pulmonary arteries and veins--

100
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,017
remember, the pulmonary
artery was blue.

101
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:39,024
As we go away from the heart,
we have de-oxygenated blood,

102
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,061
but it's still an artery.

103
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,006
Then as we go towards the heart
from the lungs, we have

104
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:45,039
a vein, but it's oxygenated.

105
00:04:45,039 --> 00:05:12,016


106
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,099
So that's this little loop here
that we start and I'm

107
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,075
going to keep going over the
circulation pattern because

108
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,056
the heart can get a little
confusing, especially because

109
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:22,026
of its three-dimensional
nature.

110
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:27,000
But what we have is, the heart
pumps de-oxygenated blood from

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,008
the right ventricle.

112
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,050
You're saying, hey, why is
it the right ventricle?

113
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,060
That looks like the left side of
the drawing, but it's this

114
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,058
dude's right-hand side, right?

115
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:37,068
This is this guy's right hand.

116
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,010
And this is this dude's
left hand.

117
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,056
He's looking at us, right?

118
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,079
We don't care about
our right or left.

119
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,064
We care about this guy's
right and left.

120
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:44,052
And he's looking at us.

121
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,020
He's got some eyeballs and
he's looking at us.

122
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,079
So this is his right
ventricle.

123
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,006
Actually, let me just start
off with the whole cycle.

124
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:54,011
So we have de-oxygenated blood
coming from the rest of the

125
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:55,036
body, right?

126
00:05:55,036 --> 00:06:00,006


127
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:04,022
The name for this big pipe is
called the inferior vena

128
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:07,031
cava-- inferior because
it's coming up below.

129
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,068
Actually, you have blood coming
up from the arms and

130
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,007
the head up here.

131
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:19,062
They're both meeting right here,
in the right atrium.

132
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,094
Let me label that.

133
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:22,086
I'm going to do a big diagram
of the heart in a second.

134
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:26,011


135
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,061
And why are they
de-oxygenated?

136
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:31,010
Because this is blood returning
from our legs if

137
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,032
we're running, or returning from
our brain, that had to

138
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,044
use respiration-- or maybe we're
working out and it's

139
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:40,037
returning from our biceps, but
it's de-oxygenated blood.

140
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,039
It shows up right here
in the right atrium.

141
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,027
It's on our left, but this
guy's right-hand side.

142
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,039
From the right atrium,
it gets pumped

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,062
into the right ventricle.

144
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:53,086
It actually passively flows
into the right ventricle.

145
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:56,052
The ventricles do all the
pumping, then the ventricle

146
00:06:56,052 --> 00:07:00,025
contracts and pumps this blood
right here-- and you don't see

147
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:02,098
it, but it's going behind
this part right here.

148
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:05,074
It goes from here through
this pipe.

149
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,057
So you don't see it.

150
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:09,097
I'm going to do a detailed
diagram in a second-- into the

151
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,039
pulmonary artery.

152
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,093
We're going away
from the heart.

153
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,079
This was a vein, right?

154
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,063
This is a vein going
to the heart.

155
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:24,012
This is a vein, inferior
vena cava vein.

156
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,056
This is superior vena cava.

157
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:25,099
These are veins.

158
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:27,013
They're de-oxygenated.

159
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,050
Then I'm pumping this
de-oxygenated blood away from

160
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,033
the heart to the lungs.

161
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:35,062
Now this de-oxygenated blood,
this is in an artery, right?

162
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:37,067
This is in the pulmonary
artery.

163
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:41,023
It gets oxygenated and now
it's a pulmonary vein.

164
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:45,056
And once it's oxygenated, it
shows up here in the left--

165
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:49,006
let me do a better color than
that-- it shows up right here

166
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,058
in the left atrium.

167
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:53,082
Atrium, you can imagine-- it's
kind of a room with a skylight

168
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:57,064
or that's open to the outside
and in both of these cases,

169
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,089
things are entering from above--
not sunlight, but

170
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,031
blood is entering from above.

171
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,031
On the right atrium, the blood
is entering from above.

172
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,011
And in the left atrium, the
blood is entering-- and

173
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,094
remember, the left atrium is
on the right-hand side from

174
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:12,057
our point of view-- on the
left atrium, the blood is

175
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:16,031
entering from above from
the lungs, from

176
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:18,012
the pulmonary veins.

177
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,011
Veins go to the heart.

178
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:24,050
Then it goes into-- and I'll go
into more detail-- into the

179
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,081
left ventricle and then the
left ventricle pumps that

180
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:33,001
oxygenated blood to the rest
of the body via the

181
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,061
non-pulmonary arteries.

182
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:36,053
So everything pumps out.

183
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,051
Let me make it a nice dark,
non-blue color.

184
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,017
So it pumps it out
through there.

185
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,016
You don't see it right here,
the way it's drawn.

186
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:45,005
It's a little bit of
a strange drawing.

187
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,061
It's hard to visualize, but I'll
show it in more detail

188
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,041
and then it goes to the
rest of the body.

189
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,012
Let me show you that
detail right now.

190
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:54,066


191
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,075
So we said, we have
de-oxygenated blood.

192
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,035
Let's label it right here.

193
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:01,059
This is the superior
vena cava.

194
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,096
This is a vein from the upper
part of our body from

195
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,098
our arms and heads.

196
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,053
This is the inferior
vena vaca.

197
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:10,090
This is veins from our abdomen
and from our legs and the rest

198
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,080
of our body.

199
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,055
So it it first enters
the right atrium.

200
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:18,046
Remember, we call the right
atrium because this is

201
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,064
someone's heart facing us, even
though this is on the

202
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,071
left-hand side.

203
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,087
It enters through here.

204
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:24,078
It's de-oxygenated blood.

205
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:26,024
It's coming from veins.

206
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,025
the body used the oxygen.

207
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,010
Then it shows up in the right
ventricle, right?

208
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,066
These are valves in our heart.

209
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:37,044
And it passively, once the right
ventricle pumps and then

210
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:40,035
releases, it has a vacuum and
it pulls more blood from the

211
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:40,076
right atrium.

212
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:44,054
It pumps again and then it
pushes it through here.

213
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,011
Now this blood right here--
remember, this one still is

214
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,013
de-oxygenated blood.

215
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:52,090
De-oxygenated blood goes
to the lungs to become

216
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,019
oxygenated.

217
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:59,035
So this right here is the
pulmonary-- I'm using the word

218
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,037
pulmonary because it's going
to or from the lungs.

219
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:03,097
It's dealing with the lungs.

220
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,085
And it's going away
from the heart.

221
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:13,059
It's the pulmonary artery
and it is de-oxygenated.

222
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:17,075


223
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:25,019
Then it goes to the heart, rubs
up against some alveoli

224
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:31,005
and then gets oxygenated and
then it comes right back.

225
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:36,099
Now this right here, we're
going to the heart.

226
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:38,024
So that's a vein.

227
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:40,037


228
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:45,064
It's in the loop with the lungs
so it's a pulmonary vein

229
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:49,000
and it rubbed up against the
alveoli and got the oxygen

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,062
diffused into it so
it is oxygenated.

231
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:53,092


232
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:56,074
And then it flows into
your left atrium.

233
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,051
Now, the left atrium, once
again, from our point of view,

234
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:00,052
is on the right-hand side, but
from the dude looking at it,

235
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,023
it's his left-hand side.

236
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:04,004
So it goes into the
left atrium.

237
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:06,064
Now in the left ventricle, after
it's done pumping, it

238
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:10,011
expands and that oxygenated
blood flows

239
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:11,037
into the left ventricle.

240
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,087
Then the left ventricle-- the
ventricles are what do all the

241
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:16,087
pumping-- it squeezes and
then it pumps the

242
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,064
blood into the aorta.

243
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:22,017


244
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,012
This is an artery.

245
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:27,026


246
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,020
Why is it an artery?

247
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,038
Because we're going away
from the heart.

248
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,095
Is it a pulmonary artery?

249
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:35,037
No, we're not dealing with
the lungs anymore.

250
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,001
We dealt with the lungs when
we went from the right

251
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,091
ventricle, went to the
lungs in a loop,

252
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:41,055
back to the left atrium.

253
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,076
Now we're in the
left ventricle.

254
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,089
We pump into the aorta.

255
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:46,054
Now this is to go to the
rest of the body.

256
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:50,001
This is an artery, a
non-pulmonary artery-- and it

257
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,026
is oxygenated.

258
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,094


259
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:56,049
So when we're dealing with
non-pulmonary arteries, we're

260
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,003
oxygenated, but a pulmonary
artery has no oxygen.

261
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:02,050
It's going away from the heart
to get the oxygen.

262
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,025
Pulmonary vein comes from the
lungs to the heart with

263
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,095
oxygen, but the rest of the
veins go to the heart without

264
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,074
oxygen because they want to
go into that loop on the

265
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,087
pulmonary loop right there.

266
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:14,070
So I'll leave you there.

267
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,048
Hopefully that gives-- actually,
let's go back to

268
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,020
that first diagram.

269
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,077
I think you have a sense of how
the heart is dealing, but

270
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:22,075
let's go look at the rest
of the body and just

271
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,034
get a sense of things.

272
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,016
You can look this up on
Wikipedia if you like.

273
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,022
All of these different
branching points have

274
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:34,020
different names to them, but
you can see right here you

275
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,045
have kind of a branching off, a
little bit below the heart.

276
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,008
This is actually the
celiac trunk.

277
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,037


278
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:45,003
Celiac, if I remember correctly,
kind of refers to

279
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:46,008
an abdomen.

280
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:50,050
So this blood that-- your
hepatic artery.

281
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,094
Hepatic deals with the liver.

282
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:56,079
Your hepatic artery branches off
of this to get blood flow

283
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,097
to the liver.

284
00:12:57,097 --> 00:13:01,012
It also gives blood flow to
your stomach so it's very

285
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,077
important in digestion
and all that.

286
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:05,024
And then let's say this
is the hepatic trunk.

287
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,000
Your liver is sitting
like that.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,007
Hepatic trunk-- it delivers
oxygen to the liver.

289
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,012
The liver is doing
respiration.

290
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:15,090
It takes up the oxygen
and then it

291
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,054
gives up carbon dioxide.

292
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:21,078
So it becomes de-oxygenated and
then it flows back in and

293
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,071
to the inferior vena cava,
into the vein.

294
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,020
I want to make it clear--
it's a loop.

295
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,048
It's a big loop.

296
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:30,062
The blood doesn't just flow out
someplace and then come

297
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:31,028
back someplace else.

298
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:33,020
This is just one big loop.

299
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,041
And if you want to know at any
given point in time, depending

300
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:42,000
on your size, there's about
five liters of blood.

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,024
And I looked it up-- it takes
the average red blood cell to

302
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:49,038
go from one point in the
circulatory system and go

303
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,062
through the whole system and
come back, 20 seconds.

304
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:54,033
That's an average because you
can imagine there might be

305
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,048
some red blood cells that get
stuck someplace and take a

306
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,092
little bit more time and some
go through the completely

307
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,089
perfect route.

308
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,078
Actually, the 20 seconds
might be closer

309
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:02,074
to the perfect route.

310
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,019
I've never timed it myself.

311
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,023
But it's an interesting thing to
look at and to think about

312
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:07,069
what's connected to what.

313
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:12,014
You have these these arteries up
here that they first branch

314
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:17,016
off the arteries up here from
the aorta into the head and

315
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:20,064
the neck and the arm arteries
and then later they go down

316
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:26,055
and they flow blood to
the rest of the body.

317
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:28,095
So anyway, this is a pretty
interesting idea.

318
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:35,025
In the next video, what I want
to do is talk about, how does

319
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:40,011
the hemoglobin know when
to dump the oxygen?

320
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:43,030
Or even better, where to dump
the oxygen-- because maybe I'm

321
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,083
running so I need a lot of
oxygen in the capillaries

322
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,034
around my thigh muscles.

323
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,040
I don't need them necessarily
in my hands.

324
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,070
How does the body optimize where
the oxygen is actually

325
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,091
delivering?

326
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,066
It's actually fascinating.

327
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,002

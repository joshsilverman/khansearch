1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,086


2
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:04,011
Two corrections I want to make
to the video on the sodium

3
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:04,076
potassium pump.

4
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:07,041
One very minor one-- and I don't
think it would trip too

5
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:11,000
many of you guys up, but near
the end of the video, as we

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,005
learned, we have potassium
getting pumped into the cell

7
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,073
by the sodium potassium pump.

8
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,064
Let me draw the membrane.

9
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:20,026
It'll actually be useful
in the more significant

10
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:23,041
correction I'd like to make.

11
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,087
So let me draw a cross section
of a cell membrane.

12
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:30,078
And let me draw the sodium
potassium pump right here.

13
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:33,057


14
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:36,075
We saw it pumps out three
sodiums for every two

15
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:40,018
potassiums that it pumps in.

16
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,085
It definitely doesn't
look like that, but

17
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,088
it gives the idea.

18
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:50,068
And we're pumping potassium
ions in-- so K plus-- and

19
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:52,072
we're pumping sodium ions out--
and that's what the

20
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:54,046
whole point of that video was.

21
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:58,000
When this thing changes shape
with ATP, it pumps

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,078
the sodium ions out.

23
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,086
Now the minor correction I want
to make-- and I don't

24
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:06,029
think it would have tripped you
up too much-- is near the

25
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:10,079
end of that video, I drew the
potassium ions-- and I wrote a

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,042
K plus, but a few times near
the end of the video, I

27
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:16,029
referred to them as sodium
ions-- and I don't want that

28
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,078
to confuse you at all.

29
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,075
It is potassium ions that
are getting pumped in.

30
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:25,004
Two potassium ions get pumped in
for every three sodium ions

31
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,070
that get pumped out.

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,085
So I don't want-- even thought
I drew a K plus, sometimes I

33
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,032
said sodium by accident.

34
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,093
Don't want that to
confuse you.

35
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:33,070
That is the minor error.

36
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,012
The more significant error is
that I said that the main

37
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,054
reason that we had this
potential difference-- why it

38
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:49,004
is more positive on the outside
than the inside-- so

39
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,026
this is less positive.

40
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:54,006
I said that the main reason
was because of this ratio.

41
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:58,031
We're pumping out three sodium
ions for every two potassium

42
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,073
ions that we pump in.

43
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:02,070
And I just got a very nice
letter from a professor of

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,001
physiology, Steven Baylor at
University of Pennsylvania,

45
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,012
and he wrote a very interesting
email and it

46
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:08,093
corrects me.

47
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:11,075
And it's a very interesting
thing to

48
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,083
think about in general.

49
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,021
So here's what he wrote
and let's think

50
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:15,040
about what he's saying.

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,031
He says: Here at Penn Medical
School, we have a nice

52
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,047
teaching program that stimulates
the ion fluxes

53
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:24,062
across a generic cell, --So
the ion flux is just the

54
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:28,065
movement of the ions across the
membrane-- including that

55
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,034
due to the sodium potassium
pump and that which arises

56
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:33,009
from the resting

57
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,059
permeabilities of the membrane.

58
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:39,055
So the resting permeabilities
is how easy it is for these

59
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:42,084
ions to go through
the membrane.

60
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:45,027
And we'll talk more about
that in a second.

61
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:48,013
And the resting permeabilities
of the membrane to sodium,

62
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:53,005
potassium, chloride,
et cetera.

63
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:58,012
One option our program gives
students is to change the pump

64
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,075
stoichiometry from
three to two.

65
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:04,015
So when he's talking about pump
stoichiometry from three

66
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,019
to two, he's just talking
about they're

67
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,034
changing the ratios.

68
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:09,040
So they change it
from 3:2 to 2:2.

69
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,084
So what that means is, they have
a simulation program that

70
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:15,052
says, well, what if the sodium
potassium pump, instead of

71
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:19,003
pumping three sodiums out for
every two potassium it pumps

72
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,041
in, what if it was even?

73
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,081
What if it was two sodiums
and two potassiums?

74
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:27,031
And based on my explanation of
why we have this potential

75
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,090
difference, that should not lead
to a potential difference

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,087
if the main reason was the
stoichiometry-- the ratio of

77
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,087
sodium being pumped to the
potassium being pumped in.

78
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:39,062
But he goes on to say: They
could change it to 2:2 in the

79
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,068
simulation.

80
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:45,050
As a result of this maneuver,
the membrane potential changes

81
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,006
from its normal value of about
-80 millivolts-- and they

82
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:50,003
measure that.

83
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:53,075
They take the voltage here minus
the voltage there so

84
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,078
that you get a negative
number.

85
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:55,094
This is more positive.

86
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:57,024
It's a larger number.

87
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:01,030
So it changes from -80
millivolts to about -78

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,084
millivolts.

89
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:04,050
So what he's saying is, if you
change this from three and

90
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,096
two-- three sodiums for every
two potassiums that get pumped

91
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,062
in-- if you change that to
2:2, it actually doesn't

92
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:11,078
change the potential
that much.

93
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:16,031
You still have a more positive
environment outside than you

94
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,062
have inside.

95
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:21,045
So that leads to the question--
then why do we have

96
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:25,002
the potential if the
stoichiometry of this ratio is

97
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,087
not the main cause?

98
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:30,061
So it says, it changes
a little bit.

99
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,098
The potential difference becomes
a little bit less.

100
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:35,031
The cell swells a few percentage
and then everything

101
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:36,033
stabilizes.

102
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:39,075
So then he goes on to write: So
while it is true that the

103
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:43,029
normal stoichiometry of the
pump does have a slight

104
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:48,000
negative influence on the
membrane potential-- that's

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,010
just the membrane potential,
the voltage across the

106
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,075
membrane-- the imbalance in the
pump stoichiometry is not

107
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:56,058
the main reason for the large
negative membrane

108
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,018
potential of the cell.

109
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:02,012
Rather, the main-- let me
underline this-- the main

110
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:06,079
reason is the concentration
gradients established by the

111
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,035
pump in combination with the
fact that the resting cell

112
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:17,036
membrane is highly permeable to
potassium and only slightly

113
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:19,061
permeable to sodium.

114
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:23,037
So we said in the last video--
or the first video on the

115
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:27,064
sodium potassium pump-- we said
there were channels that

116
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:32,042
the sodium could go through and
there's also channels that

117
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,077
the potassium could
go through.

118
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:39,002


119
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:42,049
And now what he's saying is
that the main cause of the

120
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:46,089
potential difference isn't this
ratio, it's the fact that

121
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:50,056
the membrane is highly permeable
to potassium.

122
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:52,057
So this is very permeable.

123
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:56,063
Potassium can get out if it
wants to, much easier than it

124
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:59,016
is for sodium to get in.

125
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:01,075
So what that happens-- even if
this was a 2:2 ratio-- it's

126
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:05,055
actually a 3:2, but even if
this was a 2:2 ratio, even

127
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,004
though this environment is more
positive, you're just

128
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:11,045
more likely to have to potassium
ions down here bump

129
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,019
in just the right way to get
across and get to the other

130
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,093
side, go against its chemical
gradient, right, because you

131
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:20,012
have a higher concentration of
potassium here than over here.

132
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,042
So you're more likely to have
a potassium bump in just the

133
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,098
right way to get through this
channel and get out-- than you

134
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,042
are to have a sodium be able to
go the opposite direction.

135
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,050
And that's what makes
this environment.

136
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,069
So you have more potassium
coming outside because of this

137
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:38,058
permeability than sodium coming
inside-- and that's the

138
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:42,037
main cause of the potential
difference between the outside

139
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:43,069
and the inside.

140
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,093
And so thank you, Steven Baylor,
for that correction.

141
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:47,041
Very interesting.
